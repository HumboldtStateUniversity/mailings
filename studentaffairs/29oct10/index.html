							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Hello Lumberjacks,</p> 
							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">As some of you may know, the CSU and UC were working on a joint effort to register 60,000 students to vote in the upcoming midterm elections on November 2nd. Each CSU was expected to register 10&#037; of its student body by October 18. The goal for Humboldt State University was 800 students. HSU exceeded this goal by registering 879 students. And, HSU was ranked third out of all 23 CSUs for highest percentage of students registered to vote &#40;110&#037;&#41; and was one of only four CSUs to meet the 10&#037; goal.</p>

							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">During this Voter Registration Drive, a friendly wager was made with CSU Stanislaus over who would register the most students. HSU won, meaning that the AS President from Stanislaus, and another representative will have to dress up like Lumberjacks at the next California State Student Association conference at CSU East Bay. Photos will be posted on the HSU Associated Students Facebook page.</p>

We would like to also thank the Residence Halls staff and students, the Athletics Department, CFA, the PAC club, and others for their cooperation and hard work in conjunction with AS and CSSA on this state-wide effort. We would also like to thank all those who registered with AS and encourage everyone registered to vote to do so on November 2.</p>
