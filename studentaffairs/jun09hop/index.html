					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Dear Faculty and Staff,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We are once again expecting over a thousand prospective freshmen to attend the Humboldt Orientation Program (HOP). HOP has programs to "seal-the-deal" with new students, e.g., academic advising, peer and college connections, learning-success strategies and course registration. Additionally, we offer orientation programs for the parents of the student participants.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">As part of the HOP Parent Program we will be holding welcome receptions for the families/guests of our new students so that they may meet our academic leaders, faculty and staff. We are extending an invitation to you to join us. This is an opportunity for the parents and guests of our new students to get acquainted and to ask questions about HSU and your programs. Your presence would add to the personal touch HSU offers. These receptions will be held at the Aquatics Center in Eureka. Beverages and hors d'oeuvres will be provided at the receptions as well as bus service to and from HSU to the venue. The Humboldt Bay Aquatic Center is located at 921 Waterfront Drive next to the Adorni Center in Eureka.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The dates and times of the 2009 Summer HOP Welcome Receptions are:</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Thursday June 18th from 6:00 PM - 7:30 PM<br>
					Thursday June 26th from 6:00 PM - 7:30 PM<br>
					Thursday July 9th from 6:00 PM - 7:30 PM<br>
					Thursday August 20th from 6:00 PM - 7:30 PM</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Please email Jyoti Rawal (<a style="color: #546a38" href="mailto:jvr2@humboldt.edu">jvr2@humboldt.edu</a>) to let us know which receptions you will attend. We will send out an email reminder before each reception.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Steven V. Butler<br>Vice President, Student Affairs</p>
