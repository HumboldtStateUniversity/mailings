					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Campus community,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We want you to know that the campus is closely monitoring the swine flu outbreak, and is taking actions based on response plans we have in place. The advisory below provides some details and is being sent to all HSU students, faculty and staff. Please particularly note the recommendations regarding personal precautions.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">For campus updates, check the Humboldt State website. More detailed information is available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/swineflu" style="color: #476931;">www.cdc.gov/swineflu</a> and the World Health Organization at <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/en/index.html" style="color: #476931;">http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/en/index.html</a>.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;"><strong>HSU Swine Flu Advisory</strong></p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">HSU officials and the campus Student Health Center are closely monitoring the human swine flu outbreak and will provide regular updates about the campus response at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/" style="color: #476931;">www.humboldt.edu</a> and at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/emergency" style="color: #476931;">www.humboldt.edu/~emergency</a>.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The campus community is encouraged to visit the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta for the latest national advisories at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/swineflu" style="color: #476931;">www.cdc.gov/swineflu</a>.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Influenza, including swine flu, spreads mainly person-to-person from the coughing and sneezing of infected people. There are multiple kinds of flu with similar symptoms. A number are active locally, including common cold and flu-like illnesses that are not swine flu. Symptoms may mimic one another from one infection to the next.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">This particular swine flu concerns public health officials because it is not prevented by the most recent flu shot, meaning it could spread rapidly.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Suggested precautions:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li style="padding: 4px 0px;">Stay three to six feet away from those you observe coughing or sneezing. Avoid shaking hands.</li>
						<li style="padding: 4px 0px;">Wash your hands thoroughly and often with soap and hot water, especially after you sneeze or cough.</li>
						<li style="padding: 4px 0px;">When soap and hot water are not readily available, alcohol-based hand wipes are effective.</li>
						<li style="padding: 4px 0px;">Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth to prevent the spread of germs.</li>
						<li style="padding: 4px 0px;">If you feel ill, CDC recommends you stay home from school or work and limit contact with others as much as possible to prevent infecting them.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">A campus plan for dealing with the outbreak is in place and the University is proceeding with preparedness measures. The Student Health Center is equipped with an isolation facility to help prevent the spread of infection. It can also purchase anti-viral drugs, but these would be dispensed only to those diagnosed with swine flu.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Campus community members who are feeling unwell are advised to stay at home and get plenty of rest. Symptoms include a temperature of 100 degrees or higher, sore throat, runny nose, nasal congestion, coughing spells and general flu symptoms like headache and body aches. Gastrointestinal symptoms may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Students should report to the Student Health Center if they are experiencing shortness of breath or unable to keep liquids down due to vomiting.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">At this time, CDC recommends that U.S. travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Mexico.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Campus updates are available at Humboldt State at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu" style="color: #476931;">www.humboldt.edu</a> and <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/emergency" style="color: #476931;">www.humboldt.edu/emergency</a>.</p>
