					<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Campus Community:</p> 
					<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Every year we see the news stories about someone drowning in the river or at the beach here on the North Coast.  Last summer, these stories hit home with the drowning death of Kang Jian, one of our international students from China.  These tragedies can seem unpredictable and random, leaving us with a mixture of fear and a sense of helplessness about our beaches and rivers.  However, with some basic safety information you can enjoy our beautiful beaches and rivers with confidence.</p>
					
					<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">1. The rivers of Northwestern California can have cold swift moving water almost any time of year because of snowmelt and irregular reservoir releases.  River bottoms often have unexpected drop offs and slippery rocks which in tandem with swift currents can get people in trouble who are just wading in the river.  The rivers also change from year to year &ndash; so you can't assume an area that was safe last year is also safe this year.  The cold water is a particular problem because it can make your arms and legs not work properly &ndash; through a process called cold water paralysis &ndash; which makes it difficult to keep your head above water. Your best protection is to always wear a life vest when on the river to help you keep your head above water in case you fall in and check the river for swift currents and steep drop offs before going inâ€”don't be fooled by a calm appearance on the surface.  Sometimes getting a higher vantage point can help you see the true nature of the river.</p>
					
					
					<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">2. The North Coast's ocean beaches also have their dangers.  Large waves can surprise you almost any time of the year, catching you off guard and pulling you quickly into the ocean. Survival in the surf in this area is difficult because of the strong currents, turbulent surf, and very cold water. The key is to not get pulled into the ocean unexpectedly in the first place.  So don't be fooled by waves that look small.  They can be small for up to twenty minutes before a big set of waves comes in and surprises you.  The best approach is to stay further back from the water than you might think is necessary &ndash; definitely way above the wet sand line - and never turn your back on the ocean.</p>  
					
					
					<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">If you have to be close to the water, and especially if you're going to be distracted, for example for surf fishing or agate hunting, consider wearing a life vest and having someone spot for you so they can let you know when larger waves begin to arrive.  These precautions may seem a bit extreme, but consider them like wearing your car's seat belt &ndash; you hope you never need but it's there if you do.</p>

But remember to always use these simple safety tips to stay safe and stay alive. </p>
