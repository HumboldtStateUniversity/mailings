						<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">Dear HSU Faculty, Staff, and Students:</p>

						<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The Spring Semester campus-wide TEST of HSU's on-campus emergency alert system will take place from 10:45 to 11:00 AM this Wednesday, March 24, 2010.</p>

											<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">There will be NO evacuations; this is ONLY A TEST of our alert systems.</p>

										       	<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">Throughout the day, you may notice "Test Today" signage on and around the campus; select (click on) special-colored informational boxes on the <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu" title="Humboldt State University" style="color: #546a38;">www.humboldt.edu</a> homepage; and hear public announcements on KHSU 90.5 FM and on 826-INFO (4636).</p>

										       												<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">Wednesday's on-campus test coincides with a larger three-county test of tsunami warning communications systems. Between 10:15 a.m. and 10:45 a.m., the Emergency Alert System (EAS) for Del Norte, Humboldt, and Mendocino Counties will be activated. The EAS alert will be disseminated by NOAA Weather Radio, as well as broadcast on selected TV and radio stations.  People watching television may see a crawler announcing that a tsunami warning has been issued; those listening to radio  may hear the EAS announcement; and those with NOAA Weather Radios with the Public Alert feature will also receive the warning message.  The message will be preceded and followed by an announcement making it clear that this is only a test.</p>

										       												<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">In some populated coastal areas of Del Norte County and Humboldt County, tsunami sirens will be tested at the same time.  A Civil Air Patrol aircraft will use a loudspeaker to announce the test in Crescent City and in the Humboldt Bay area.  In Humboldt County, a "reverse calling" message will be telephoned to listed land lines within and near the Tsunami Hazard Zone.</p>

										       												<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">On the HSU main campus between 10:45 and 11:00 am on Wednesday, you may hear the campus clocktower bells ringing continuously; you may receive an emergency text "TEST" message on your cell phone; and you will see changes on the HSU homepage during that period.</p>

										       												<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">Please attempt to call 826-INFO as soon as you receive the text message or you hear the bells, so that we can further test the capacity of that system and you can become more familiar with using it.</p>

										       												<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">In the event that there was a real emergency that affected most or all of the campus community, the alert and informational system would provide you with notice that there is an emergency condition, and with instructions as to what you should do.  Remember that the best source for the most current, detailed information about any emergency affecting HSU is <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/emergency" title="Emergency Conditions" style="color: #546a38;">http://www.humboldt.edu/emergency</a>.</p>

										       												<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">TEXT MESSAGING REGISTRATION AND UPDATE OF CELL INFO</p>
										
<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">If you have recently changed cell phone carriers, or have not yet registered your cell phone to receive emergency text messaging, an instructional link on this process is on the same site <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/emergency" title="Emergency Conditions" style="color: #546a38;">http://www.humboldt.edu/emergency</a>.</p>

<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">Feedback concerning this test/drill may be submitted to <a href="mailto:response@humboldt.edu" style="color: #546a38;">response@humboldt.edu</a>.</p>
