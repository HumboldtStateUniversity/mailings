					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Dear HSU Students:</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Good luck with your finals and we wish you a safe and happy holiday.  Most of you will be leaving soon for the semester break.  If you are driving, please use caution in your travels to and from campus, as we often experience significant storms at this time of year.  Please remember that bad weather combined with mountainous roads too often leads to vehicular accidents and tragedy.  Our concern is for your safety.  By using common sense, driving appropriately for the weather and road conditions, and being aware of driver fatigue, you should arrive at your destination safely.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The roadways can be hazardous due to rain, hail, sleet, black ice, and/or snow.  Please use caution in your travels during the break and check on road conditions before your departure from or return to the area. Our local highways are 101, 199, 299 and 36. Additionally, Interstate 5 is the main highway for north-south travel throughout the western states.</p>
				
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Here are some resources to check the current conditions before travel.</p>
