					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Campus Community,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Commencement ceremonies are this Saturday, May 16, and a large number of parents, family members and friends will be traveling to campus. We're looking forward to a day of joy and celebration, which our graduates have certainly earned.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">This year, a few extra precautions are necessary because of the H1N1 "swine flu."</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We do not believe there is an inherent risk in participating in Commencement ceremonies. However, we urge you to be informed, share information with those who plan to visit and make sensible choices.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">In particular, all individuals who plan to attend should monitor their health prior to the ceremonies. Please do not attend if you have had flu like illness in the last seven days or a known exposure to someone diagnosed as having flu.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">On the day of Commencement, campus staff will complete additional cleaning of facilities between ceremonies, and graduates will have access to hand sanitizer. The flyers about hand-washing that you may have seen around campus will be posted at various event locations. And as always, medical staff will be on hand.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">There have been no confirmed cases of H1N1 in Humboldt County, but health officials suspect it likely is or shortly will be established locally. The campus has taken steps to prepare for a possible local flu outbreak and to provide information on the best ways to stay healthy. </p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">For the latest campus updates, please visit our website at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu" style="color: #546a38; text-decoration: none;">www.humboldt.edu</a>.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Regular updates are available from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/swineflu" style="color: #546a38; text-decoration: none;">www.cdc.gov/swineflu</a> and the World Health Organization at <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/en/index.html" style="color: #546a38; text-decoration: none;">http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/en/index.html</a>.

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Thank you for your attention and cooperation. The health and safety of our campus community is a top priority, and we all have a part to play when it comes to preventing the spread of flu.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Steven Butler</p>
