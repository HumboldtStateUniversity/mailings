Cal Poly Humboldt is more than just a university; we are a close-knit community dedicated to the preservation and prosperity of our shared home. Together, it is our collective responsibility to protect this space (where we live, work, and learn) and ensure the safety of all its members—students, alums, staff, and faculty alike. We will continue to foster an environment where everyone can express themselves freely, peacefully, and respectfully. Our administration has been meeting with concerned Jewish students and groups. We are listening and will continue ongoing discussions and actions to ensure the safety of all our students. If you or anyone you know is experiencing harassment, you can
                            <a href="https://hum.link/TitleIXReport">file a report</a> with the Title IX and Discrimination, Harassment & Retaliation Prevention Office or contact the University Police Department.

                            We have hosted the Annual Campus Dialogue on Race (CDOR) since 1998. This event was established in response to President Clinton’s challenge to higher education institutions to provide safe spaces for critical dialogue on race. The idea was to celebrate our differences as a “source of richness and strength.” CDOR, led by the Social Justice, Equity & Inclusion Center, has a committee made up of faculty, staff, students, and community members. Each year they select a variety of keynote speakers and solicit proposals from across our campus and community to provide interactive sessions to facilitate the exploration of the impact of racism and oppression. This year’s program includes over 30 different workshops, presented by faculty, students, staff, and community members. Since the inception of CDOR, students have had the opportunity to earn one course credit unit for voluntary participation in any of the scheduled events. Students may attend any of the workshops they choose.</p>

                            Thank you for suggesting we include an Israeli writer and activist in a future program. We will continue to encourage the campus community to bring a variety of speakers, events, and programs to campus. Today, in fact, there is a scheduled discussion of "Jewish Solidarity and Anti-Racism." We are also excited to schedule and promote a recently added event, "What is Zionism, the Indigenous Peoples of Judea." This discussion, led by the Jewish Student Group from Chabad of Humboldt, will delve into the concept of Zionism and modern-day antisemitism. It will also explore how these topics align with this year's theme for the Campus and Community Dialogue on Race (CDOR), particularly in addressing racialized, religious, and sexual violence. The event aims to highlight the personal experience of Jewish students at Cal Poly Humboldt, focusing on issues of harassment and presenting the broader history of the Jewish people.

This event will also be hosted by the Cal Poly Humboldt Social Justice, Equity & Inclusion Center. Any suggestions for speakers, presenters, and events would be welcomed, and we encourage you to submit a proposal.</p>
