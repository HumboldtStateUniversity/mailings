                    Humboldt State will begin phasing out inactive university accounts, including email, for former campus community members, including former students, alumni, and former employees. Accounts will start to close 6 months or later after theyâ€™re no longer associated with the University.

                <mj-text padding-bottom="0">
                There are several reasons to discontinue old accounts:
                <ul>
                    <li>The high cost to the University to maintain accounts for people no longer actively affiliated</li>
                    <li>Reducing confusion regarding people with the same name</li>
                    <li>Risk to the University of people no longer associated with the campus claiming to represent HSU</li>
                    <li>Very few of the accounts are regularly used</li>
                </ul>

                <mj-text>
                 Faculty and staff are encouraged to ask graduating students for a personal email address in order to stay in contact, or encourage alumni to update their address to a non-humboldt.edu email in order to stay connected with the university.
