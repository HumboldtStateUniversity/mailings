        <mj-text>This is to share an update and additional information about support being provided as the University enforces parking regulations related to overnight camping.</mj-text>

         <mj-text>The challenges of affordable housing can be particularly acute for students, and the University is invested in supporting them. Related to the parking enforcement, numerous staff are actively working with affected students on a case-by-case basis to understand their unique needs and help them arrange alternative housing options. County staff have also been on campus providing information about resources. </mj-text>

  <mj-text>The University is offering the students free temporary housing in the residence halls through the end of fall semester, using the Dean of Studentsâ€™ basic needs funding. Students are also being offered free towing of non-functioning vehicles, and other RV parking options are being explored.</mj-text>

  <mj-text>Any of the students who choose to live in free temporary campus housing may make arrangements to park their vehicle in University lots through the end of the semester. Otherwise all overnight campers have been notified that they must vacate by noon on Sunday, Nov. 12.</mj-text>

  <mj-text>The University has had a long-standing parking regulation, <a href="https://parking.humboldt.edu/sites/default/files/approved_parking_rules_regs_effective_160125.pdf">PCSCR Article 5 - 2515(a)</a>, which was updated in 2016 and prohibits overnight camping on University property. For the health and safety of the campus community, University parking lots are not intended for overnight camping and are not equipped with the sanitation and other facilities that are necessary to support RVs or other vehicles overnight. The enforcement of this University policy was temporarily suspended during the height of the COVID pandemic, leading to an increase in the number of vehicles camping overnight in campus parking. </mj-text>

  <mj-text>If you are a student in need of assistance with housing, please use the resources that are available to you, listed below. If you know a student in need of housing assistance, please refer them to these resources.</mj-text>
