<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; margin: 0 0 0px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear University Community:</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 0px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">We are saddened to share news of the loss of Humboldt State alumnus and longtime Educational Talent Search TRiO employee, Cary Bellak. We extend our condolences to his family and friends.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 0px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Cary, a native of Southern California, died last week. As an HSU student, he was a member of the Marching Lumberjacks—through which he met some of his lifelong friends—and graduated in 1989 with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Information Systems.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 0px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">He was the first employee hired by Talent Search in 1992 and since then, he has provided data analysis and IT support. Cary was also a skilled graphic artist and took pride in designing inspiring t-shirts, event posters, program brochures, and websites as the program grew over the years. But his favorite part of his job was providing academic and college prep experiences for students. In fact, over the summer he helped coordinate a robotics camp for students and was inspired by their work.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 0px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Colleagues remember him as a loyal friend with a good sense of humor. He was an outdoor enthusiast who enjoyed kayaking and fishing. He was also passionate about good food. He worked as a sushi chef and a brewmaster at Six Rivers Brewery, and loved cooking for his friends.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 0px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">A memorial for Cary will be held at Perigot Park in Blue Lake on Saturday, Oct. 8, at 10:30 a.m. and end with a potluck at 11:30 a.m. at Mad River Brewing Company. In lieu of flowers, please make a donation in support of HSU student scholarships to the HSU Advancement Foundation in memory of Cary.
