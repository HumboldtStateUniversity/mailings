        <mj-text>Cal Poly Humboldt is a community of compassion and together, we make up a collective of individuals dedicated to fostering inclusivity and connectedness. We value communicating important topics that are weighing on all our minds.</mj-text>
        <mj-text>Among those topics is the Executive Order calling for the elimination of the Department of Educationâ€“an announcement that has raised questions and concerns about the future of student financial aid.</mj-text>
        <mj-text>The CSU and Cal Poly Humboldt continue to closely monitor the situation and currently do not anticipate any significant impact on the availability or delivery of critical financial aid programs such as Pell Grants and federal student loans. The University remains committed to helping our students receive the aid they rely on, without significant delays.</mj-text>
        <mj-text>While there may be changes at the federal level, the Financial Aid office continues to operate as usual, processing aid, assisting with FAFSA and CADAA, and addressing financial aid questions. </mj-text>
        <mj-text><strong>What You Need to Know:</strong></mj-text>
        <mj-text><ul>
          <li><strong>The financial aid process, including FAFSA, remains in place</strong>. Students should continue applying for financial aid as usual. Federal student loan servicing will continue, and repayment terms remain unchanged. </li>
          <li>
            <strong>We are here to assist you</strong> as you navigate financial aid and your educational journey, no matter what changes may come.</li>
          <li><strong>If you have any concerns</strong>, please reach out to the Financial Aid Office for guidance. Our <a href="https://humboldt.edu/financial-aid/contact">contact hours and contact information
