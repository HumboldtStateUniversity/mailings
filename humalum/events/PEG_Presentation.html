					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Please come and join us for a presentation of findings and interpretation of results for the HSU Alumni Attitude Survey, a study conducted last fall by the Performance Enhancement Group (PEG).  This email-based survey was administered at 18 different CSU&rsquo;s and  HSU had over 800 alumni respondents.   The results have really helped us understand the preferences of our alumni&hellip;and more specifically how they want to engage with the institution.  Come join us for a one hour presentation by Rob Shoss, PEG&rsquo;s senior researcher, on Thursday, March 26, 2009, at 4pm, with reception to follow at 5pm.  Location: Nelson Hall East, Room #106.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The <em>Alumni Attitude Study</em> is a cooperative effort among institutions and PEG to measure and compare the values, preferences and perceptions that motivate alumni to engage with their alma mater.  The Study has developed a reliable and cost effective survey process that provides Study participants with survey &ldquo;comparables&rdquo; and &ldquo;benchmarks&rdquo; to help assess institutional performance on alumni communication, development and programming efforts. More than 100 universities and associations have now surveyed their alumni through the Study. </p>
