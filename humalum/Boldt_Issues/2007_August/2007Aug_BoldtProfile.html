  <h3>Alli  Minch and Byron Turner, Educators Seeking an End to Violence</h3>
  <p><img src="../../images/Boldt Images/2007_Aug_Boldt/Oasis.jpg" alt="Alli Minch and Byron Turner" width="300" height="224" align="right" />For some folks, there&rsquo;s a stark line  separating the ideals they held in college and the lives they eventually lead  out there in the bigger world. And, in truth, holding fast to your convictions  can be a challenge&hellip;which is why it&rsquo;s all the more remarkable to witness how  Alli Minch and Byron Turner are not only staying true to their ideals, but are,  in fact, building on the convictions that inspired them as HSU students well  over a decade ago. </p>
  <p><strong>DEDICATED  TO HALTING VIOLENCE</strong><br />
    Alli (&lsquo;92, &lsquo;94) and Byron (&lsquo;88, &lsquo;92),  met as students at HSU, where both worked on issues of violence  and discrimination. Byron started No Means No, a campus rape prevention  program. He was also on the Community Advisory Board of Humboldt Women for  Shelter. Alli co-directed No Means No, and volunteered for both Humboldt Women  for Shelter and Grass Valley's Domestic Violence Coalition. While teaching part  time during his last two years at HSU, Byron started a nonprofit organization  called Created Equal and pulled together a Board of Directors that has  consisted of professionals and activists from across the United States. </p>
  <p>Byron and Alli married in 1999 and live  and work in Grass Valley with their four-year old sons,  Tim and Rob. Both alumni found careers in education. Alli teaches English and  History at Nevada Union High School and Byron teaches Social Science at Sierra  College. They&rsquo;ve also remained dedicated to reducing domestic  violence through the efforts of Created Equal. </p>
  <p><strong>SOFTWARE  WITH A HEART</strong><br />
    Somewhere between their time spent  teaching and raising their own children, Alli and Byron have also managed to  author a new software system that, in a twist of events, will soon help them  achieve their larger goal of halting domestic violence. </p>
  <p>The software is called TeachMac and it  began its life as a humble tool to help students in Byron's Mac classes  remember the topics they covered. The couple, however, soon realized that the  software they&rsquo;d created had much greater potential: it could help the  non-techies bridge the digital divide while raising funds to reduce domestic  violence. </p>
  <p>Here&rsquo;s how it works. </p>
  <p>TeachMac enables anyone, anywhere, with  computer knowledge to produce tutorials, which other users can subscribe to. If  you&rsquo;ve been befuddled by the intricacies of Excel or PhotoShop, for instance,  you can simply subscribe to a tutorial written by someone who knows the  programs ins and outs. Likewise, if you are an expert at some application, you  can write your own tutorial for others to download. TeachMac&rsquo;s motto says it  all: <em>Learn what you need. Teach what you  know. </em></p>
  <p>TeachMac also reflects the social  justice values of its founders. For starters, money from TeachMac subscriptions  and site licenses are used to support Created Equal. TeachMac also shares a  portion of that revenue with the tutorial authors as well. </p>
  <p>Since TeachMac&rsquo;s launch in August 2006,  Alli and Byron have received hundreds of proposals for tutorials in six  different languages. The library is approaching 200 hundred modules  representing thousands of individual video clips. </p>
  <p>TeachMac&rsquo;s runaway growth soon attracted  the attention of a company that paid $2 million for the system&rsquo;s engine. The  recent sale enabled Alli and Byron to invest even more fully to their cause:  committing the profit to founding a violence  recovery community&mdash;called the Oasis Project&mdash;that will provide sustained care to  women and children who are survivors of domestic crime.  Additionally, Byron and Alli are donating their back salaries from Created  Equal to the Oasis Project, matching community donations  up to a million  dollars.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A few years ago, Alli and I were  granted generous salaries, but we have never collected because Created Equal  didn't have the money,&rdquo; Byron&nbsp; told <em>Macsimum News</em>. &ldquo;Of course, we could  collect now. Instead, we're contributing $1 million in matching funds toward  the Oasis Project.&rdquo; </p>
  <p><strong>BACK  IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY</strong></p>
  <p>    The Oasis Project (<a href="http://teachmac.com/oasis_project">http://teachmac.com/oasis_project</a>)  will be based in Humboldt County and will focus on enabling women and children  who&rsquo;ve suffered from domestic violence to undertake long-term healing, learn  new skills and become independent. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This will be a self-sustaining,  long-term community for domestic violence survivors,&rdquo; Turner said in an  interview. &ldquo;The idea is to create a shelter that doesn&rsquo;t require continual  funding. It will be able to function on its own. If we get this right, we might  be able to build dozens of these around the country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Precisely when the Oasis Project gets up  and rolling will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of  suitable land, a feasibility study, documentation of needs and the success of  grant applications. Byron predicts that they&rsquo;ll purchase the land and start  construction somewhere between 2008-2009. A temporary rented site might be set  up in the meantime to offer limited services until the permanent facility is  ready.</p>
  <p>Why base the Oasis Project in Humboldt  County? </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We both love Humboldt County,&rdquo; the  married HSU alums said, &ldquo;but beyond that we think it would be an excellent  location for the project. The natural beauty, coupled with rural land and a  strong commitment to sustainable technologies in the region, makes it our top  choice. We&rsquo;d be naive to think we could start the Oasis Project on our own. The  accumulated knowledge represented in the community and at Humboldt State makes  Humboldt County particularly appealing. There&rsquo;s a lot of expertise here that we  would like to tap into. We&rsquo;re hoping to partner with the university to develop  and implement the project, which eventually will provide jobs for community  members and valuable work experience for students, who could intern at the site  in counseling or engineering, as the facility develops and grows. There are  many roles for students in a program like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now that the planning has begun for the  Oasis Project, Byron and Alli intend to return to Humboldt County in the near  future. In the meantime, they are interested in working together with faculty,  students and community members on this project.&nbsp; Faculty and students in  computer science, sociology, social work, women's studies, engineering,  environmental resources, economics, and others interested in contributing to  the Oasis Project can find out more by contacting Byron and Alli through the  contact link at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.teachmac.com/">www.teachmac.com</a> .&nbsp;&nbsp;They  also ask HSU grads to join them in supporting this important cause with a $10  or larger donation. Donation links can also be found at&nbsp;the  TeachMac web site, <a href="http://www.teachmac.com/oasis_project">http://www.teachmac.com/oasis<u>_project</u></a>.&nbsp; A local  contact is Board member, Professor Pamela Brown who can be reached at <a href="mailto:pb4@humboldt.edu">pb4@humboldt.edu</a> or 826-4564.</p>
