  <h3>Major  Changes for the 41st Humboldt Film Festival </h3>
  <p>This March 24-29, Humboldt County will be home to a  &quot;new and improved&quot;<a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/filmfest/">Humboldt Film  Festival</a>. The festival, which has the distinction of being the oldest  student-run film festival in the world, is now in its forty-first year -- a  year which brought some major changes with it. Festival organizers explain that  all of these changes were made in an effort to make the festival more  accessible to the entire Humboldt community. They include a reduced general  admission price, free access to all events for anyone with a current student ID  (this includes College of the Redwoods students and county high school  students), and a larger, more accessible venue in the form of the Van Duzer Theatre.  Other changes include an increased internet presence for the festival, which  has nearly quadrupled the number of submissions, resulting in a more diverse  pool of films from all over the world.</p>
  <p>The  decision to make the festival free to students and reduce general admission  prices was envisioned by Rick Hedstrom, one of the three student co-directors  of this year's fest. This will be the first time the festival has reached out  to students in this way, and the festival organizers hope this translates into  more young movie fans being able to participate in and be inspired by this  Humboldt tradition. The general admission prices will be reduced to $5 per day  for the rest of the community, which includes screenings at 3 p.m. by judges with  national reputations, as well as the 7 p.m. competitive screenings. There will  also be the option to buy a week-long pass at the discounted price of $15,  which includes all festival events. The 1 p.m. judges' workshops will be free to  all, as in previous years.</p>
  <p>The  venue for this year's festival screenings is a change from recent years in  which it was held at the Minor Theatre. Although this change may come as a  surprise to some in the community, the festival's co-directors stress that this  is actually a return to the fest's original home on the HSU campus at its 1967  inception. This would seem to be a good year for the festival to come home, as  The Van Duzer recently acquired a state-of-the-art projector that is capable of  producing a much larger, crisper image than the digital projectors used in  recent years. As the festival organizers point out, the Van Duzer theatre also  has a better sound system, more comfortable seating, and plenty of&nbsp; parking spaces. Even the concessions stand at  intermission is getting an upgrade: the festival plans to go &quot;beyond  popcorn,&quot; adding fresh local coffee, pastries, and even pizza to the  mix.</p>
  <p>This  year one of the organizers' main priorities was &quot;bringing the festival  into the twenty-first century.&quot; They began using the services of withoutabox.com,  a website that allows filmmakers from all over the world to search for and  enter festivals that meet certain criteria. This is a service they had used  before in the past, when it was a small start-up, but now, as festival  co-director Aimee Hennessy points out, &quot;like so much of what's on the  internet today, it's gone from novelty to necessity.&quot; Filmmakers now  expect to be able to access and pay for everything online. What this  modernization brings to the Humboldt Film Festival is a more diverse mix of  submissions. So far, the festival has received films from over twenty U.S.  states and over a dozen countries. </p>
  <p>&quot;This  monumental number of submissions provides a greater diversity of<br />
    topics,  genres, styles, and filmmaker origins,&quot; points out Ben Bettenhausen, HSU  grad student and festival co-director. &quot;The overall quality of these  submissions has improved, allowing us to present a more enjoyable festival  program for all kinds of film viewer.&quot;</p>
  <p>This  year the Humboldt Film Festival will be arranged into Local Filmmakers Night,  Experimental &amp; Animation Day,&nbsp;  Documentary Day, Narrative Day, and Best of the Fest. The goal is to  provide something for every taste, but the festival co-directors encourage  viewers to attend each day to broaden their appreciation of film in  general.</p>
  <p>Local  Filmmakers Night will kick off the festival on Monday, March 24th at 7 p.m.. It  will be a showcase of the best in contemporary Humboldt County filmmaking. This  will include HSU student films, HSU alumni films, and films from community  members.</p>
  <p>Experimental  and Animation Day (Wednesday the 26th), will be judged by New York filmmaker Ry  Russo-Young. She will be showing her short film 'Marion' and giving a free  workshop on experimental filmmaking at 1 p.m.. At 3 p.m., she will be screening her  new feature film 'Orphans,' which won a special  jury prize at the 2007 SXSW Film Festival and continues to screen at numerous  festivals in the U.S. and abroad. <em>Orphans </em>is the story of two estranged sisters who reunite  at an isolated farmhouse and relive their dark past. At 7 p.m., Russo-Young will  judge the competitive international festival screenings in the Experimental and  Animation categories. </p>
  <p>Documentary  Day (Thursday the 27th) will be judged by Joaquin Alvarado. Alvarado is&nbsp; &nbsp;an award-winning Chicano filmmaker whose works  include <em>The Silent Cross</em>. He is also the Founding Director of the&nbsp;Institute for Next  Generation Internet&nbsp;at SFSU, President of the Board for the Bay Area Video  Coalition,&nbsp;and a leading member of the City of San Francisco Digital Media  Advisory Committee. He will be giving a free workshop at 1 p.m., a multimedia  presentation at 3 p.m., and judging the competitive international Documentary  screenings at 7 p.m.</p>
  <p>Narrative Day (Friday the 28th) will be presided over by Lori  Petty. Petty is a well-known actress, as well as a director, a writer, a  painter, and a clothing designer. She has played alongside Madonna and Geena  Davis in <em>A League of Their Own</em>, opposite Keanu Reeves in <em>Point  Break</em>, opposite Robin Williams in <em>Cadillac Man</em>, and  alongside Gina Gershon in <em>Prey For  Rock 'n Roll</em>. Petty also played the title character in the  post-apocalyptic cult classic <em>Tank  Girl</em>, based on the comic of the same name. She will  be giving a free workshop at 1 p.m., showing one of her films (TBA) at 3 p.m., and  judging the competitive international Narrative screenings at 7 p.m.</p>
  <p>Best  of the Fest Night (Saturday the 29th) will be emceed by Lori Petty. The winners  in the Experimental, Animation, Documentary, and Narrative categories will be  screened again, along with the Audience Choice Award winner. This event starts  at 7 p.m.</p>
  <p>All  events are scheduled to take place in the Van Duzer Theatre, which is located  on the HSU campus.Tickets for the Humboldt Film Festival will be available at  the door during festival week events.
