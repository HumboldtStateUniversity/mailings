  <h3>The Music Inside&mdash;the North Coast Connection</h3>
  <p><img src="../../images/Boldt Images/2009_Nov_Boldt/kurt011-(2).jpg" alt="Kurt Kroesche, photo credit: Matt St. Charles" width="500" height="281" />When his HSU faculty colleagues in the Theatre, Film &amp; Dance department said they wanted to include a film screening in the year&rsquo;s production schedule, David Scheerer saw it as a way to take care of some unfinished business, as well as to provide some unique opportunities for HSU students. </p>
  <p>The unfinished business was a feature film, shot in 2005 when Scheerer taught film at Montana State University.  Using professional actors, some of whom he&rsquo;d met during his years working on what became the Sundance Film Festival, he directed the script of a former screenwriting student, Michael Van Wagenen.  But test screenings revealed some problems, and the project was shelved. </p>
  <p>Scheerer and Van Wagenen discussed a solution&mdash;a different way to frame the story of a mentally ill young man and his relationship with a young woman who was a social worker on an NYU internship.  But the new version required a new character, and new scenes amounting to about a third of the complete film. </p>
  <p>So Scheerer asked his HSU colleagues &ldquo;if they would be willing to support me in shooting these new scenes.  Much to my joy, the season selection committee agreed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So last fall, students who took a pre-production workshop became involved in making what essentially is a new movie.  &ldquo;They looked at the first cut, and helped me identify what worked and what didn&rsquo;t work.  They helped me in rewriting the script, casting the new scenes, and doing all the pre-production work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/Boldt Images/2009_Nov_Boldt/Ireland04a1.jpg" alt="Theresa Ireland, photo credit: Matt St. Charles" width="250" height="197" align="right" />This included building a set in the Studio Theatre: the office of a professor of theology, who has a secret past. He is confronted there by a young woman journalist, and is compelled to tell his story.  That story, which goes back some twenty years, reveals him to be that 
    mentally ill young man in the first version.  Kurt Kroesche, now an award-winning San Francisco actor, returns in that role.  The young journalist is played by Theresa Ireland, known on the North Coast for theatre roles at North Coast Rep (<em>Jake&rsquo;s Women, Pirates of Penzance</em>) and Ferndale Rep (<em>Bus Stop, Anatomy of a Murder</em>) as well as local commercials and independent films. </p>
  <p>Students helped build the set, which had movable walls so that director Scheerer could shoot from any angle.  Students were also among the crew when the scenes were shot in January, between the first and second semesters. </p>
  <p>In fact, the set became something of a community effort.  &ldquo;Since our professor&rsquo;s field is theology, we wanted to have artifacts from all religions in his office, so a lot of people across the campus helped to collect them,&rdquo; Scheerer said.  &ldquo;These artifacts are important to the story, because part of his mental illness had been his belief that he was a prophet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; To do the shoot, I brought in Brian Wilcox, a professional cinematographer and a friend of mine,&rdquo; Scheerer said.  &ldquo;And Panavision gave us the Super 16 film package, so our students got experience working with a high-end professional film package, and with a professional cinematographer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Other interior and exterior scenes were also shot on the HSU campus (&ldquo;though we never say in the script what university it is&rdquo;), and the crew journeyed up 101 to Trinidad to film a key scene&mdash;in fact, the first scene of the movie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We were going to shoot the opening on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, because of its iconic quality,&rdquo; Scheerer said.  &ldquo;But Luffenholtz Beach in Trinidad turned out to be so beautiful and so appropriate.  We filmed at sunset on a gorgeous January day&mdash;it&rsquo;s such a striking and impressive opening sequence that it won out over the bridge.&rdquo; <br />
      <br />
    HSU students then helped edit and finish the film, in a post-production workshop last spring.</p>
  <p>Theatre, Film &amp; Dance faculty also participated in the new scenes: Jody Sekas designed the set, Rae Robison designed the costumes, and James McHugh worked on the lighting with cinematographer Wilcox. </p>
  <p>Scheerer also enlisted Music Department professor J. Brian Post to write new score elements. Art Department professor Wayne Knight created the storyboards for the new scenes, and designed the titles and poster elements.  Knight died in October of complications from the H1N1 virus.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve added a title to the film,&rdquo; Scheerer said, &ldquo;dedicating the screenings at HSU to Wayne.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The North Coast scenes comprise the part of the story that takes place in the present.  The scenes filmed in 2005 are now flashbacks to the past.  They star Amy Redford, daughter of Robert Redford, who has acted in a number of independent films as well as television series episodes.  Other stars are veteran film actors Mary Ellen Trainor and Brian Wimmer.</p>
  <p>The participation of HSU students and faculty who worked on the film doesn&rsquo;t necessarily end with the sneak preview screenings.  While in Montana in 2005, Scheerer had created a cooperative ownership of <em>The Music Inside</em>, with the help of lawyer John Frohnmayer, former director of the National Endowment of the Arts.  Essentially, everyone who worked on the film owns a piece of it, and shares in any future profits. <br />
      <br />
    &ldquo;The reason I&rsquo;m pioneering the cooperative approach is because of my background at Sundance,&rdquo; Scheerer said.  &ldquo;I really believed in the independent film movement in the 80s, and I could never find a way that the producers didn&rsquo;t end up owning the work and making all the money. We&rsquo;d rather divide the profits with the people who made the film.&rdquo;  Because of the North Coast shoot, HSU students are now among those people.</p>
  <p>Profits could come from television and DVDs, perhaps after a tour of international film festivals. &ldquo;If it works,&rdquo; Scheerer said, &ldquo;it could change the way independent films are made.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two sneak preview screenings at the Van Duzer Theatre are part of the process of getting <em>The Music Inside</em> ready for its future.  &ldquo;This is still a work in progress,&rdquo; Scheerer said.  &ldquo;Since we are still able to change things, we are eager for audience feedback.&rdquo; Those who attend the screenings will be asked to fill out questionnaires. </p>
  <p>The Sneak Previews of <em>The Music Inside</em> are at 7:30 PM on Friday, November 13 and Saturday, November 14 in the Van Duzer Theatre on the HSU campus in Arcata.  Tickets are $10, $8 students and seniors, with a limited number of free seats to HSU students for each performance, from the HSU Box Office (826-3928) or at the door. <a href="http://HSUStage.blogspot.com">http://HSUStage.blogspot.com</a>.</p>
