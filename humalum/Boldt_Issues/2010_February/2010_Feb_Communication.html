  <h3>HSU Intercollegiate Speech &amp; Debate, Fall 2009</h3>
  <p>The Fall 2009 competitive season has been very fruitful for the HSU Intercollegiate Speech &amp; Debate team.  The program is open to all undergraduate students and it provides the wonderful challenge and opportunity to test their critical thinking acumen in both debate and individual speaking events.</p>
  <p>The HSU squad competes as part of the Northwest Forensics Conference, which is comprised of four-year universities (both public and private) and community colleges from Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, and Montana.  HSU is the only program from California.</p>
  <p>The genre of debate that the students compete in is known as British Parliamentary (or BP debate.)  The format consists of four pairs of debate partners; two on the Government (whose job is to affirm the resolution) and the Opposition (who must oppose the resolution and refute the affirmatives&rsquo; arguments.)  The topics change from round to round and they are typically taken directly from the current event cycle (i.e. climate change policy, Afghanistan, War on Terror, the economy, etc.)  The HSU debaters are constantly keeping up with what&rsquo;s going on the world, both on the domestic front as well as the global scene, because one never knows what topics are going to come up&mdash;so it is best to prepared for everything!<br />
    Here are the results from two recent tournaments this semester:</p>
  <p>Linfield College, November 20-22<br />
      <br />
    The Humboldt State University intercollegiate speech &amp; debate team  did very well at the 57th annual Mahaffey Tournament at Linfield College in McMinnville Oregon. </p>
  <p>HSU had three teams entered in British Parliamentary debate.  Our top novice team (Devin McDonnell and Natalie Daughton) not only broke to the final round, but ending up winning the entire division.  Our top open team (Jeff Gutierrez and Emily VanGerpen) broke to the semi-final round.  Devin and Natalie were also honored with top speaker awards (first place for Devin and third place for Natalie.)</p>
  <p>In individual speaking events, the HSU squad also found quite a bit of success.  Cecilia Phillips, who attended her very first forensics tournament in her life, won first place in novice dramatic interpretation.  Emily VanGerpen and Devin McDonnell continued earning trophies with taking first and second place respectively in novice extemporaneous speaking.  Natalie Daughton and Alyssa Lomier also took finalist awards in extemporaneous speaking and program of oral interpretation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Lower Columbia College, November 6-8</p>
  <p>A much-needed injection of ethos, energy, and esteem was found at the 37th annual Smelt Classic at Lower Columbia College in Longview Washington. </p>
  <p>HSU entered five separate debate teams and all five teams cleared into out rounds (which was a record for Humboldt State&rsquo;s debate program.)  Devin McDonnell and Natalie Daughton made it to the final round and took second place.  Ian Cossar and Tony June&mdash;both Communication majors and former football players for HSU&mdash;also went to the final round and took finalist trophies.  The three other HSU debate teams also walked away with awards as semi-finalists: Aurora Maddocks &amp; Stefan Kreid, Tim Thiel &amp; Krystina Thurin, and Jeff Gutierrez &amp; Emily VanGerpen.</p>
  <p>Natalie Daughton&mdash;competing in any form of debate for the very first time&mdash;worked very hard and earned the first place speaker award in novice BP debate.</p>
  <p>The HSU individual events competitors also did well.  HSU dominated novice extemporaneous speaking, with Tim Thiel taking first place and Emily VanGerpen taking second. </p>
  <p>The combined points earned for both BP debate and individual events earned the HSU squad first place overall in the four-year university division.  The team worked very hard, clocking in numerous practice debates during class.  The perseverance and dedication to excellence paid off.</p>
  <p>As with the rest of the University, the HSU team will be taking a little time off during the winter break.  However, there still a few more competitions to look forward to and team members are dedicated to working hard and bringing their best into many more rounds in the next few months.<br />
