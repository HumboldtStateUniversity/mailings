  <h3>Distinguished  Alums Partner in New York Times Best Seller Quest</h3>
  <p><em>By  Kevin Daum ('86) </em></p>
  <p>There I was, 43, enjoying life in Manhattan,  kayak fishing in New England on the weekends, nearly debt free. &nbsp;I had  done all the right things for 20 years, built an Inc. 500 company established  myself as an expert in my field. &nbsp;Heck, I even authored &ldquo;Building Your Own  Home For Dummies&rdquo; and was named Distinguished Alum for HSU. When&nbsp;<strong>Boom!&nbsp;</strong>Everything  went bust!&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than 6 months my entire world disappeared.  IndyMac and Lehman were my largest investors. &nbsp;I was done!</p>
  <p>That was my life in Spring 2008. I had to  scramble.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a son getting ready for college. On the one hand I  was angry!&nbsp;&nbsp;How could this happen?!?&nbsp;&nbsp;Not my  fault!!!&nbsp;Next was the brutal realization that I didn&rsquo;t even know how to  find a job and being a typical entrepreneur I was completely  unemployable.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to take stock of the resources I had and find a  way to support my family, and retain my self-respect. </p>
  <p>Over the years I had been the chief marketer  for my company and had consulted in arts/business and marketing mostly for  fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying on the support of my friends and a do anything approach  learned from an HSU degree in Theatre Arts, I was able to leverage my writing  ability, knowledge, experience and passion to build a Customer  Experience/Marketing consultancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I quickly sold a new book&nbsp;<em>Green$ense: Rating the Real Payoff for  50 Green Home Projects to </em>The Taunton Press for release in 2010 and started  networking to increase my clientele.</p>
  <p>I had never networked with HSU alumni much  because I wasn&rsquo;t sure where the value would be living in the East and not being  in Natural Sciences.&nbsp;&nbsp; But looking  through an issue of the Bolt I stumbled across Ken Fisher as another  Distinguished Alum.&nbsp; Ken is also an  entrepreneur and we had written for the same publisher.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know what a relationship with a best  selling author and billionaire would bring but I figured he was someone it  couldn&rsquo;t hurt to know.&nbsp; The question for  myself was whether or not I could bring value to him.</p>
  <p>I reached out to Ken.&nbsp; It took some doing to get through the  gatekeepers but due to my Distinguished Alum status and our common interests he  granted me a rare meeting&mdash;I really think were it not for that and the prior  relationship with Wiley I wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten through but it was worth a shot.&nbsp; I went into that meeting with no agenda other  than to make a connection with someone who shared a love for HSU.&nbsp; We spoke for a while and discussed our paths.&nbsp; We found common ground in our desire to see  HSU alumni gain value from involvement and connection to the university.&nbsp; We started working on an HSU project that  fell victim to budget cuts but gained mutual respect for each other.</p>
  <p>In December 2008 I wrote a charming parable <em>ROAR!  Get Heard in The Sales and Marketing Jungle</em>, a unique story that identifies  a 3500-year-old sales process direct from the Jewish Passover  seder.&nbsp;&nbsp;The book had some traction in the business world and I sent  it to Ken to see what he thought.&nbsp; He  told me liked it and was kind enough to pen an endorsement for the cover.&nbsp; When it became clear that the book had real  potential Ken offered to take it to Wiley.&nbsp;  I had a Wiley relationship from my Dummies book but I knew Ken&rsquo;s  influence would matter and it did.&nbsp; Even  Ken won&rsquo;t get Wiley to buy a bad book but in this difficult publishing  environment I know it was the support of an influential alumni relationship  that made Wiley take a good look.</p>
  <p>Wiley has now picked up the book ROAR! to  release in April and we are on the path to being a New York Times bestseller or  as I like to call it... The Quest for the Jewish Super Bowl  Ring!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>ROAR</em>&nbsp;is already attracting clients and a big  following in it&rsquo;s pre-release.&nbsp;Of course it didn&rsquo;t hurt that I gained some  press attention by tattooing New York Times Best Seller on my chest backwards  so I could see my goal in the mirror every morning.&nbsp; I am learning much from Ken&rsquo;s publishing  success and I hope Ken is &nbsp;learning some  new tricks from my theatrical approach as well.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;m a strong believer in the ties that we have  from shared experience and the experience of attending Humboldt State is a  powerful one that lasts a lifetime.&nbsp; When  my son was picking colleges I told him that the alumni program was probably the  most important factor in choosing the school.&nbsp;  For now I know first hand that alumni connections can have impact  throughout your life and career.&nbsp; Few  have a story compelling enough to engage a billionaire but there are thousands  of HSU alumni who will network freely and can help each other. All you have to  do is reach out.</p>
