					  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Open Letter to the Humboldt State University Community:</p> 
					   					   
					   
<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">During the spring 2012 term the California State University conducted a three-year review of Rollin C. Richmond, the president of Humboldt State University. The review concluded on May 8, 2012 with a discussion of the review by the CSU Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees and I appreciate the contributions of those who worked with us on this review.</p> 

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">The Board of Trustees' criteria for assessing the performance of a president and of the institution include the overall management of the institution, relations on campus and within the system, educational leadership, community relations, major achievements of the campus and the president, and personal characteristics of the president. Faculty, staff, students, alumni, and community representatives were invited to submit written comments responding to the trustees' criteria.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dr. Richmond has been at the helm of the campus during the worst budgetary cutbacks the CSU system has ever experienced. Respondents both inside and outside of the university expressed appreciation for his management of the budget crisis as well as his efforts to restructure the university. Faculty, staff, and community members expressed admiration for his willingness to enact change, his ability to stand up to the pressures of restructuring, his effective choices in staff leadership, and his ability to shape a university for the future.</p> 

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">At the campus level, respondents applauded his efforts to revise the shared governance structure by creating a new University Senate. Various respondents praised the University Senate as a "remarkable achievement" that has "created a healthier campus community." He also won praise for his support of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programs and for his development of an internship program that works with local businesses. From a system-wide perspective, he earned plaudits for his strong leadership of the Council on Ocean Affairs, Science and Technology (COAST) initiative, and for his ongoing support of the Water Resources and Policy Initiatives (WRPI) and CSU Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB) initiatives.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Regarding community relations, several community members took the opportunity to congratulate President Richmond for his involvement with and commitment to the community, especially in the area of K-12 schools; and in rebuilding trust in the advancement office and in the foundation.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">On a personal level, he was commended for his calm, straightforward demeanor, sound judgment, excellent communication skills, and objectivity.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 3px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Accomplishments at Humboldt State during the review period include a reorganization of the advancement office and foundation; a renewed focus on grants and scholarship; increased faculty and student diversity; the building of an on-campus hydrogen fueling station as part of California's Hydrogen Highway program; the completion of Schatz Energy Laboratory, College Creek Apartments, the Kinesiology/Athletics complex, and the Behavior and Social Sciences building; and a major remodel of Harry Griffith Hall.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 3px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dr. Richmond and I discussed this review and established the following goals:</p>


<ul style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 30px; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">
<li>Continue to develop the advancement office and foundation and continue to raise external funding for the university.</li>
<li>Continue to recruit students from across California, especially students of color.</li>
<li>Continue to strive for diversity among the faculty and staff.</li>
</ul>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 3px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dr. Richmond is deeply committed to the success of Humboldt State University and its students, staff, and faculty. He is an energetic, dedicated, motivated, and very capable president for this institution, and he has helped build its reputation throughout California and across the country. We congratulate Dr. Richmond on a successful review and we look forward to Humboldt State's continued growth and development under his leadership.</p>


<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">With kind regards,</p>
