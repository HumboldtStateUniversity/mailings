							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Greetings HSU Fisheries Alumni!</p>


							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">As HSU approaches its 100th anniversary and the HSU Fisheries program turns 64, we can all see continuing rapid changes to our academic programs and to higher education in general. But, we have all been doing our best to maintain HSU&rsquo;s fine tradition of hands-on, field-oriented instruction that has served our alumni so well and has taken full advantage of our wonderful location. Maintaining the quality of specialized academic programs like Fisheries Biology will require continued support from private donors, including our alumni. I am pleased to share highlights of our program with you.</p>

							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">This past year has been a period of transition for the HSU Fisheries Biology program, as faculty and staff retire or near retirement:</p>

                            <ul style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 30px 4px 30px; text-align: left;">
								<li>Gary Hendrickson retired after 33 years of service</li>
								<li>Kristine Brenneman entered the Faculty Early Retirement Program (FERP) and will teach spring semesters only for the next five years</li>	
								<li>Dave Hankin will finish the third of five years in the FERP program</li>	
								<li>Tim Mulligan will enter the FERP program this coming fall, teaching during fall semesters only</li>	
								<li>Helen Mulligan retired after having taught Fish Physiology for almost 20 years</li>	
								<li>Walt Duffy, Leader, CA Cooperative Fish Research Unit, will retire in February 2014</li>	
								<li>Eric Loudenslager, Fish Hatchery Manager, retired in January 2013 after 30 years of service</li>		
							</ul>

							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">We've been working hard to make sure that the next generation of faculty and staff will continue the fine traditions of the previous generations. Next year, we will recruit for a tenure-track faculty position in Aquaculture/Fish Biology. We are also very excited about our new Fish Hatchery Manager, Sabine Mader Willis. Sabine holds an MS in aquaculture from a Norwegian university and most recently spent four years as program manager of a very successful university/private industry sturgeon production facility in North Carolina.</p>

							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">There is lots of activity to report, especially in the marine fisheries area:</p>

                            <ul style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 30px 4px 30px; text-align: left;">
								<li>A network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) was established off northern California and there is $4 million of funding available for baseline monitoring so that changes in abundance of marine resources can be compared to conditions at MPA establishment.</li>
								<li>The HSU Fishing Lumberjacks were featured in the Spring 2012 issue of Humboldt magazine (<a style="color: #075540;" href="http://magazine.humboldt.edu/spring12/the-fishin-lumberjacks">http://magazine.humboldt.edu/spring12/the-fishin-lumberjacks</a>). These HSU Fisheries alumni are mad about fishing for tuna. You might want to join them!</li>	
								<li>Recent Marine Lab upgrades were featured in the Spring 2012 issue of Humboldt magazine (<a style="color: #075540;" href="http://magazine.humboldt.edu/spring12/marine-lab">http://magazine.humboldt.edu/spring12/marine-lab</a>). These included a complete renovation of the wet lab; replacement of all display aquaria, including installation of an awesome new 10&rsquo; x 4&rsquo; rectangular tank and new LCD displays above all aquaria (with photos and videos of fish and invertebrates); development of a new small aquarium room; and complete renovation of our algae and zooplankton culture room. Funding for these great improvements was provided from an NSF grant, private donors, and HSU alumni donors. Thank you!</li>

                            <ul style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 30px 4px 30px; text-align: left;">
								<li>Andrew Kinziger is investigating genetic approaches that would allow monitoring the presence/absence of the endangered tidewater goby using environmental DNA in water samples. Additionally, he and his students are conducting a conservation breeding program for tidewater goby, with some recent success. Video of the spawning and mating behavior of tidewater goby can be seen at: <a style="color: #075540;" href="http://youtube.com/user/fishesdude">youtube.com/user/fishesdude</a></li>
								<li>Tim Mulligan has been working over the past year with stakeholders (commercial and sport fishers, Native American tribes, local governments, conservation groups, etc.), and other scientists, to develop several large multi-collaborator proposals to monitor the recently established MPAs. He and his wife, Helen, plan to continue their work on fish and invertebrate communities in natural and restored wetlands in Upper Klamath Lake Marsh this spring.</li>	
								<li>Darren Ward and students have been working on juvenile coho and Chinook salmon life history strategies in local streams and in the Klamath River basin. Darren also has an ongoing study of invasive New Zealand mud snails in Redwood National Park that has received some local media attention: <a style="color: #075540;" href="http://northcoastjournal.com/news/2011/06/02/invasion-big-lagoon/">northcoastjournal.com/news/2011/06/02/invasion-big-lagoon/</a></li>
								<li>Dave Hankin served on two extremely interesting scientific review panels over the past year and a half. One panel was asked to determine if there is adequate justification for further reduction in Chinook salmon fisheries in order to rebuild the endangered Southern Resident Population of killer whales! Dave also served as a member of the California Hatchery Scientific Review Group that has recommended substantial changes in operation of CA&rsquo;s salmon and steelhead hatcheries (<a style="color: #075540;" href="http://cahatcheryreview.com/about/">cahatcheryreview.com/about/</a>).</li>
								<li>Peggy Wilzbach has just completed studies of Klamath River polychaetes that have
been indirectly responsible for substantial mortalities of juvenile Chinook salmon. Her upcoming projects include a basin-wide study of hybridization between coastal cutthroat trout and steelhead in the Smith River.</li>
								<li>Eric Bjorkstedt continues to run the PaCOOS program to provide year-round ship-based ocean observations off the North Coast (see <a style="color: #075540;" href="http://now.humboldt.edu/news/hsu-noaa-team-fills-historic-north-coast-oceanographic-gap/">http://now.humboldt.edu/news/hsu-noaa- team-fills-historic-north-coast-oceanographic-gap/</a>). Eric also served as Chair of the Science Advisory Panel for the North Coast MPAs.</li>

                            <ul style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 30px 4px 30px; text-align: left;">
								<li><img style="display: block; float: right; margin: 10px 0 10px 10px;" src="http://humboldt.edu/mailings/fisheries/june13/displaycase.jpg" alt="display case" /> Terry Roelofs has enjoyed some globe-trotting (Costa Rica, New Zealand, Spain and Bulgaria) since his recent retirement, and some very fun “fishing for science” with colleagues Reeves (HSU MS) and Hankin in Alaska, but he confesses that he still very much misses interacting with, learning from and being challenged/inspired by students. Terry, with help from Rich Ridenhour, promises to make a major effort to boost our alumni web page presence – stay tuned. Terry has also been working with Hankin to develop a display devoted to fly-fishing for Atlantic salmon, using a fine donated collection of fly rods, fly reels, flies and other fishing items.</li>
								<li>Ron Fritzsche will travel to Barbados and St. Vincent in the Caribbean and Alaska this year and has a new FAO (UN) in-press publication on fishes of the West Coast of Africa.</li>	
								<li><img style="display: block; float: right; margin: 10px 0 10px 10px;" src="http://humboldt.edu/mailings/fisheries/june13/ridenhour.jpg" width="221" height="282" alt="Rich Ridenhour" /> Rich Ridenhour continues his international travels – Borneo and England – where he searches for birds! Rich volunteers for Friends of the Arcata Marsh and has been leading tours of Humboldt Bay for Humboldt Baykeepers.</li>
								<li>Recognition plaques have now been developed for George Allen, John DeWitt, Jim Welch, and Rich Ridenhour. These are posted in the Wildlife and Fisheries Building and can be viewed on the web at: <a style="color: #075540;" href="http://humboldt.edu/fisheries/alumni/alumni.html">humboldt.edu/fisheries/alumni/alumni.html</a></li>

								<li>Aileen Nimick (co-recipient of this year&rsquo;s Michael Scott Outstanding Student Award) recently completed an internship studying white sharks in South Africa.</li>
								<li>Elena Dolitsky and Hayley Aronson recently completed exchange aquaculture programs at Universitetet i Nordland (University of Nordland), above the Arctic Circle.</li>	
								<li>Keith Parker, a Yurok tribal member and HSU re-entry student, spent several months working with USFS fishery biologists on the Copper River delta in Alaska last summer. Keith gave a presentation on his research at the American Indian Science and Engineering Society national conference in Anchorage last November and was awarded 2nd place nationally as a presenter, receiving a scholarship check and an engraved Apple IPAD!</li>

                            <ul style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 30px 4px 30px; text-align: left;">
								<li>Daniel Schindler, Professor of Aquatic and Fishery Science, University of Washington,
will deliver the inaugural Michael G. Scott Distinguished Lecture on October 9. Daniel is
a world recognized expert on dynamics of aquatic ecosystems. His talk will focus on the proposed Pebble Mine (gold and copper), its possible impact on Bristol Bay salmon, and the role of fishery scientists in environmental disputes. This distinguished lecture series was established through a very generous bequest from Cuthbert L. Scott to honor the memory of his son, Michael G. Scott (&rsquo;75 B.S. Fisheries).</li>
