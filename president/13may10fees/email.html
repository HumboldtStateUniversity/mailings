									<tr>               
										<td class="mainbar" align="center" valign="top" style="padding: 22px 0 0 14px; text-align: left;">
											<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Students and Colleagues:</p> 
											<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">As you know, the university community has been having discussions about the possibility of increasing two student fees - the Student Health Center Fee and the Instructionally Related Activity Fee - and creating a new fee, the Materials Services and Facilities Fee, which would replace 532 existing course fees. For many students, the fees would be at least partially covered by financial aid.</p>

																		<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">The Student Fee Advisory Committee (SFAC) has recommended that I approve the Student Health Center Fee increase and the Materials Services and Facilities Fee (MSF). The group did not recommend an increase in the Instructionally Related Activity (IRA) Fee, but several student members of the Advisory Committee were supportive because of the need to pay for increases in the cost of the JackPass program. This program, though very successful, has been operating at a large deficit.</p>

																		<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">The Vice Presidents and I consulted broadly on campus regarding two of the proposed fee changes before making a recommendation to the Chancellor. Detailed information about the MSF fee was made available on the Provost's website. Two of the possible fee changes were discussed at several open forums on campus, at the Associated Students Council and at the Executive Committee of the Academic Senate. In addition, an advertisement with information about the MSF fee was published in the Lumberjack. The Associated Students included all the proposed fees or increases as ballot initiatives to consider in their recent election. A small proportion of students chose to vote on these initiatives and supported the Health Center Fee but not the MSF Fee or the IRA Fee increase.</p>

																		<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">While the university did a good job of consulting broadly on campus with regard to the new MSF fee and the increase in the Student Health Center Fee, we only consulted with a few groups (SFAC, Intercollegiate Athletic Advisory Committee) about the increase in the IRA fee.  While the Associated Students Council discussed this fee, the administration did not provide spokespersons to explain the fee.  After consultation with the Associated Student Leadership, I have decided not to increase the IRA fee until we have the opportunity to consult broadly with the appropriate constituencies on campus.  </p>


																		<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">After considering all of this information, I have recommended to the Chancellor that Humboldt State University increase its fees as follows beginning with the Fall Semester of the 2010/11 academic year.</p>
											<ul  style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 40px; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">
												<li>Student Health Center Fee increase of $45 to fund Counseling and Psychological Services, bringing the Fall 2010 rate to $192.</li>

												<li>Materials Services and Facilities Fee for full-time students of $144 per semester to replace 532 course fees and to help maintain the quality of education that HSU has traditionally provided to its students. Part-time students will pay $72 per semester.</li>

											</ul>

											<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Chancellor Reed has informed me that he has approved these fees increases.  We will reconsider the IRA Fee increase during the 2010/11 academic year.  The total increase for full-time students for the two approved fees will be $189 per semester.  </p>

																		<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">I regret having to increase the cost of attending Humboldt State University for our students. However, the reality is that until the State of California reconsiders its priorities and restructures its dysfunctional political system, student fees of various types will continue increasing in future years. </p>

																		<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">For Humboldt State, it is critical that we do everything possible to maintain the high quality of the education we provide and the services that students expect. These are the reasons that demand for admission to HSU is higher than ever. Even after the increases, Humboldt State University will continue to be one of the best higher education values in the nation.</p>

											<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">
												Sincerely, <br /> <br />
												Rollin C. Richmond<br/> 
												President
