					<p style="padding: 2px 0px;">Dear Campus Community,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 2px 0px;">Welcome back for Spring Semester at Humboldt State University. I hope you had an enjoyable and restful Winter Break.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 2px 0px;">One highlight for me in recent weeks was attending the annual CSU Biotechnology Symposium. Humboldt students were especially impressive. One of our undergraduate students was one of 10 selected for a research award from among 234 posters presented at the meeting. Our faculty members from Biological Sciences are playing significant roles in the CSU-wide Biotechnology Program and clearly doing an excellent job of teaching their students how to be good scientists.</p>
 
					<p style="padding: 2px 0px;">The new buildings that have been and are being built on our campus are providing a new visual perspective for prospective students and for the rest of us. Our new student housing has already dramatically changed what HSU looks like and will provide some excellent opportunities for our students starting in the Fall. The new Kinesiology &amp; Athletics Building and the new plaza entrance to the Redwood Bowl are significant improvements. The student-originated, student-supported and student-led Humboldt Energy Independence Fund has already resulted in photovoltaic cells on top of our music building and new lights for the Redwood Bowl that will reduce energy use significantly and reduce light pollution to the neighboring communities. Hurray for our students who are making such a real difference for the campus.</p>

					<p style="padding: 2px 0px;">As I mentioned at our Spring Welcome event last week, this semester promises to be a busy one, with numerous campus-wide efforts demanding our attention. These include completing our reaccreditation process with WASC, tackling recommendations from our Cabinet for Institutional Change, and continuing with academic program review.</p>

					<p style="padding: 2px 0px;">As part of completing our reaccreditation, we will host a visit by a team from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) Feb. 3-5. The team will meet with individuals and groups, and will host a number of forums. They will also accept input through a confidential email at <a href="mailto:wasc2hsu@yahoo.com" style="color: #546a38">wasc2hsu@yahoo.com</a>. More information, including a copy of the final Educational Effectiveness Review that we submitted to WASC, is at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/wasc" style="color: #546a38">www.humboldt.edu/wasc</a>. I encourage everyone in our community to review this excellent document in advance of the WASC group's visit.</p>

					<p style="padding: 2px 0px;">The Cabinet for Institutional Change, which was formed last year in response to a number of campus issues, has completed most of its work. It will issue its final set of recommendations soon, which will include ideas for improving campus governance. More information is at <a href="http://change.humboldt.edu" style="color: #546a38">http://change.humboldt.edu</a>.</p>

					<p style="padding: 2px 0px;">The new curriculum review process led by the Provost and adopted by the Academic Senate is in place, and we are making real progress in redesigning our curriculum to meet the recommendations from the Program Prioritization process. Ultimately, this will help us do a better job of retaining students. It will also help us meet the goals for graduation rates set by the Chancellor's Office. More about Program Prioritization is at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/aavp/Prioritization.html" style="color: #546a38">www.humboldt.edu/aavp/Prioritization.html</a>.</p>

					<p style="padding: 2px 0px;">Our work related to WASC, program prioritization and other areas of campus change is difficult, but will serve us well when the state's budget situation improves. We will be well-positioned to take advantage of better times.</p>

					<p style="padding: 2px 0px;">We will continue to monitor the state's financial situation. It is encouraging that the Governor has made higher education a priority in his recent budget proposal, but California's economy is still struggling. In addition, I am convinced that the economy is not the only problem. Our state's political system is terribly dysfunctional, and major reforms are needed. But there is hope for change. The bipartisan group called California Forward is working with the Legislature and the Governor to make changes in the system that no longer serves us well. If you have not already done so, I encourage you to review what California Forward is proposing and urge our legislative representatives to support their proposals. The future of Humboldt State University depends upon real political change in California.</p>

					<p style="padding: 2px 0px;">You can find HSU budget updates, as well as a Budget Book explaining how HSU uses its resources, at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/budget" style="color: #546a38">www.humboldt.edu/budget</a>.</p>

					<p style="padding: 2px 0px;">I will work to keep you informed about important campus-wide topics throughout the semester. In addition, I ask everyone involved with campus committees and other governance groups to share information with their colleagues. We all have a part to play in helping the campus make well-informed decisions.</p>

					<p style="padding: 2px 0px;">Once again, welcome back from the Winter Break. I wish you an enjoyable and productive semester.</p>

					<p style="padding: 2px 0px;">Sincerely,</p>
