				<td class="mainbar" align="center" valign="top" style="padding: 22px 0 0 14px; text-align: left;">
<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Students and Colleagues:</p> 
					  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">I want to make sure that you are aware of the various campus priorities for this academic year. Many decisions as well as new initiatives will be driven by them.</p>

					       	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Because everything we do should support who we are, our institutional priorities must align with our Vision, which has shaped the goals we developed for our reaccreditation through WASC and those established by the Cabinet for Institutional Change (CIC). The Change Steering Committee 2010-2011 Campus Report detailing progress achieved to date can be found at: <a href="http://change.humboldt.edu/" style="color: #476a31; text-decoration: none;">http://change.humboldt.edu/</a>.</p>
					       	
					       	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;font-weight:bold;">Our Vision states:</p>
					       	
					       	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 2px 10px 20px; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;"><em>Humboldt State University will be the campus of choice for individuals who seek above all else to improve the human and environmental condition. We will be the premier center for the interdisciplinary study of the environment and its natural resources. We will be a regional center for the arts. We will be renowned for social and environmental responsibility and action. We believe that it is the individual citizen, acting in good conscience and engaging in informed ethical action, who will preserve and advance our world. We will commit to increasing our diversity of people and perspectives. We will be an exemplary partner with our communities and tribal nations. We will be stewards of learning that makes a positive difference.</em></p>
					       	
					       	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">This year's priorities, as outlined at Convocation, are: Enrollment Management, Communication, a Campus Portal, Faculty and Administration involvement in Shared Governance, Sustainability and Curriculum, a Policy File, Interdisciplinary Grants and restructuring Campus Committees.</p>
					       	
					       	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Both our accreditation review by WASC and the recommendations of the CIC emphasized the importance of coming together around our vision. The CIC said that not only should we work to more deeply ingrain our vision in our culture, but also to advance our vision in the University's planning and budgeting. Sustainability is a core value that has repeatedly emerged when discussing Humboldt's identity. By focusing on<em> Sustainability in the Curriculum</em>, in <em>Interdisciplinary Research</em>, and in our physical plant, we will continue to implement this vision in concrete ways.</p>
					       	
					       	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Another focus for this year is in the area defined by CIC as a collegial, respectful and responsive community. This priority will take the form of improving campus <em>Communication</em> by way of several distinct initiatives. One initiative is the <em>Campus Portal</em> that we can use to communicate more effectively with students, staff and faculty. Another is an online <em>Policy File</em>, which will be a repository for easy access to all University-wide policies and senate resolutions. We also plan a campus survey and use of focus groups to ask about mechanisms that are most effective for communicating with one another.</p>
					       	
					       	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">An important step toward achieving a collegial and responsive community is implementing a <em>University Senate</em> and <em>restructuring Campus Committees</em> to allow all constituencies to come together to develop University policy within a cohesive governance structure that helps ensure student success.</p>
					       	
					       	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Student success remains our top priority and the most important expression of who we are as an institution. <em>Course Transformation</em> based on the assessment of student learning offers some of the best ways to promote inclusive student-learning successes; a variety of course transformations are already well underway in the three academic colleges. A comprehensive <em>Enrollment Management Plan</em> will provide an outline for recruiting, retaining and graduating all of our students. Our commitment to student success requires that we make progress in each of these areas and particularly in improving the proportion of our students who truly become a part of our academic community, make timely progress in learning the outcomes that characterize a Humboldt education, and graduate to make a positive difference in the world.</p>
