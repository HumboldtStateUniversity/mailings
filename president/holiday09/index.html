					<p style="padding: 5px 0px;">Friends and Colleagues,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">As the fall semester nears an end, I want to wish you a happy holiday season. </p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Each semester begins with anticipation of what lies ahead; often there are challenges, and this one certainly had its share. What is most important though, is that all semesters end with the satisfaction of having done our best on behalf of the students. I have always felt that the commitment to students is particularly striking here at Humboldt State. It is this commitment that should always bring us together in the end.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">I know that our students deeply appreciate all that you do. They often tell me about staff and faculty members who go out of their way to help them with a variety of issues. They talk about how Humboldt has changed their outlook and improved their lives. Your efforts truly make an important difference.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">I look forward to working with you in the new year and to our students returning for the spring semester. I know that they will continue to inspire us.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">I wish you and yours all the best in the coming year. Enjoy your well-earned vacation, and if you are travelling, please be safe. </p>					
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Happy Holidays,</p>
