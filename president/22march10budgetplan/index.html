						<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">Dear Campus Community,</p>

						<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">After working closely with the Vice Presidents, the University Budget Committee and others over the last few months, I have approved a Budget Plan for the next fiscal year. Our focus for 2010-11 will be on the same three priorities as during the current year:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Student success, including retention, graduation and diversity </li>
							<li>Campus fiscal stability and enhancing revenue</li>
							<li>Service to the North Coast</li>
						</ul>

											<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">In early February, I sent the University Budget Committee the proposed Budget Plan that had been developed by the Provost, the Vice Presidents and me. We were conservative with our planning. Given California's struggling economy and drops in state revenue, funding for public higher education in the state will almost certainly be far below what is needed. I would rather finish the next fiscal year with a balance than risk being forced to make additional budget cuts mid-year.</p>

										       	<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">Our Budget Plan calls for an operating base budget of $95 million, which requires an augmentation of $658,000 from one-time University Contingency Reserve funds. The plan assumes we would have a carry-over from this year of one-time funds of approximately $5.6 million after accounting for stimulus funding and unallocated student fee revenue. The plan also assumes a 10 percent student fee increase and that we will go over our enrollment target by about 1 percent.</p>

										       												<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">The Budget Plan does not call for further base budget reductions at this time. Instead, the $658,000 shortfall will be covered by one-time funds until we have a better understanding of the budget situation.</p>

										       												<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">The Budget Plan provides the following limited amount of one-time funding: $575,000 to backfill Academic Affairs' multi-year reduction plan as well as $1.5 million in stimulus funds for extra classes, $36,000 for staffing the Diversity and Inclusion Office, $73,000 for staffing the Institutional Research Office and $60,000 for an initiative to increase retention of freshmen and sophomores. In addition, we will continue to fund a $500,000 President's Campus Initiative Reserve, which has funded faculty and student travel to conferences, professional education, stipends for developing online courses, purchase of musical instruments and lab equipment, infrastructure for biotechnology education and more.</p>

										       												<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">In its response to the proposal, the University Budget Committee commended the approach of budgeting conservatively and it reported unanimous support for the overall Budget Plan. The Committee supported the one-time funding described above as key investments for the University. </p>

										       												<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">Finally, the Committee requested an annual update each fall on the use of the one-time University Contingency Fund. That is a good and reasonable suggestion, and we will make that part of the annual budget process.</p>

										       												<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">It is important to note that this Budget Plan is based on the best current estimates and projections for the state budget. If the final actions of the Governor and State Legislature cause our situation to change significantly, I will provide an updated Budget Plan to the Committee.</p>

						Rollin C. Richmond  <br/>
						President</p>
