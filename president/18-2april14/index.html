<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Please join me in congratulating the faculty award recipients for 2013-14, each of whom was recommended by the University Senate.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">They are: Professor Eugene Novotney, Outstanding Professor; Professor Jeffrey M. Black, Scholar of the Year; Professor Justus Ortega, Excellence in Teaching; Lecturer Maral N. Attallah, Excellence in Teaching; and Professor and Chair Kenneth Fulgham, Outstanding Service Award.</p>
<ul style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 25px; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">
	<li>Professor Novotney, Department of Music, has mentored Humboldt State students for nearly three decades. His teaching incorporates his travels to India, China, Indonesia, Brazil and Ghana to study ethnomusicology. In 2013, Novotney advanced to the quarterfinals of the GRAMMY Foundation’s National Music Educator Award. In 2006 he received the Wang Family Excellence Award from the CSU Trustees for his "exemplary contributions and achievements in his academic discipline." He has also composed 18 published original works.</li>
	<li>Professor Black, Department of Wildlife, made news for his study of river otter populations in which he enlisted students, hikers, fishermen and other community members to determine the health of the animals locally. He’s employed the same inclusive strategy to study eight other species. Black’s study of the Steller’s jays and their social relationships has been well documented. Black, who joined the Humboldt State faculty in 1998, has published more than 100 papers and books.</li>
	<li>Professor Ortega, Department of Kinesiology & Recreation Administration, is recognized nationally for his head trauma studies. Ortega utilizes his ability as a researcher to dispense knowledge in a passionate, yet practical manner. Students consistently relate how he instilled confidence that aided the development of their own research skills. Outside the classroom, Ortega makes himself available to students for advice and instruction on a wide variety of topics, from writing code for data analysis to learning how to network with professionals.</li>
	<li>Lecturer Attallah, Department of Critical Race, Gender & Sexuality Studies, has taught 10 different courses, from high enrollment general education subjects to small activity classes during the past decade. Consistent in all of her efforts, according to her colleagues, is an "ability to teach highly controversial and challenging subject material while creating a classroom of respect, dialogue and community." Those characteristics have helped Attallah effectively expose the perspectives and voices of marginalized groups in society through her teaching.</li>
	<li>Professor and Chair Fulgham, Department of Forestry & Wildland Resources, has held many prominent faculty leadership positions during his 30-year career at HSU, advocating for the academic community’s involvement in the operations of the university. His roles have included General Faculty President, Chair of the Academic Senate and President of the California Faculty Association. Fulgham has also served as president and treasurer of the California-Pacific (CALPAC) Section of the Society for Range Management.</li>

Each will also have an opportunity to deliver a public lecture during the upcoming academic year.</p>
