				<td class="mainbar" align="center" valign="top" style="padding: 22px 0 0 14px; text-align: left;">
					  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Colleagues,</p> 

			       	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">I am pleased to announce that Mr. Craig Wruck will be joining Humboldt State University as our new Vice President for University Advancement. He brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to our campus.</p>

							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">The Search Committee and those who met Craig during his campus visit spoke highly of his qualifications and, perhaps more importantly, his clear dedication to higher education. I believe he will be an excellent fit at Humboldt State.</p>

							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Craig comes to HSU from St. Cloud State University, where he has been serving as Vice President for University Advancement. St. Cloud State is the largest of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, with more than 17,000 students and 120,000 alumni.</p>

							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Craig has served in many roles throughout his 30-year career at universities and foundations. I am particularly impressed by Craig's experience in planned giving, which includes literally writing the book on the subject &ndash; titled <em>Planned Giving in a Nutshell</em>. Craig is past president of the Partnership for Philanthropic Planning and has served as a member of its board of directors and chairs its government relations committee. He is a founding member of the Editorial Advisory Board of the newsletter <em>Planned Giving Today</em> and serves on the Editorial Review Committee of <em>The Journal of Gift Planning</em>. Craig is also a teacher and frequent speaker on charitable giving topics.</p>

							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Craig's many awards include a Distinguished Service Award by the National Committee on Planned Giving. He has also been honored with the David M. Donaldson Distinguished Service Award presented by the Planned Giving Group of New England and the Clinton A. Schroder Award from the Minnesota Planned Giving Council.</p>

							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Craig holds an MBA from the University of St. Thomas and a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Utah. He and his wife Liz, who is a Guardian ad Litem, have two adult sons, one of whom is a newspaper advertising manager and the other a professor of sociology.</p>

							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">I would like to thank the members of the Search Committee for their good and diligent work. I also want to express my appreciation to Frank Whitlatch, who has capably served as Interim Vice President during the last two years. Frank will continue to serve as HSU's Associate Vice President for Marketing &amp; Communications.</p>

							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Craig will begin work at Humboldt State in early December, and I invite you to join me for a reception to welcome Craig at a time to be announced later.</p>

							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Sincerely,<br /><br /><img alt="Signature - Rollin C.
