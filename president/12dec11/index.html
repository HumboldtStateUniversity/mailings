							<p style="padding: 5px 0px;">Happy Holidays</p>
							
							
							<p style="padding: 5px 0px;">Friends and Colleagues,</p>
							
							<p style="padding: 5px 0px;">Thank you to everyone who participated in our new Faculty and Staff Holiday Party last week, and a special thanks to those who helped plan and staff it. I understand it was a great success. I wish I could have joined you, but it was important for me to attend an Executive Council meeting in Long Beach during these uncertain financial times.</p>  
							
							<p style="padding: 5px 0px;">It is hard to believe, but final exams are getting underway today and another semester is coming to a close.</p> 
							
							<p style="padding: 5px 0px;">I want to extend to you my best wishes for a happy holiday season. I hope you are able to enjoy the time off for rest and rejuvenation, as well as the opportunity to spend extra time with family and friends. You deserve it.</p>
							
							<p style="padding: 5px 0px;">Sometime over the next few weeks, you may want to spend some reflecting on the many ways in which you make a difference for our students, and congratulate yourself. Your efforts - large and small, campus-wide and one-to-one - all contribute to our students' academic and social development. I believe that experience, of making a lasting and positive difference, is one of the great benefits of working in higher education.</p>
							<p style="padding: 5px 0px;">Please have a safe and enjoyable holiday season. I look forward to continuing our work together next semester.</p>					
							
							<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,</p>
