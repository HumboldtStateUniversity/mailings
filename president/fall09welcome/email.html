					<p style="padding: 5px 0px;">Dear Students,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The start of fall classes is just a couple weeks away. I know that for many of you, enthusiasm about the start of the semester is mixed with concern about fee increases and the impact of state budget cuts on campus. A number of students have contacted my office and other campus offices with questions, and your apprehension is certainly understandable.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">I am writing you today for two reasons.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">First, I want to reassure you that despite this year's very difficult budget cuts, Humboldt State University is still operating and is still one of the best higher education values in the nation. It remains essentially the same place you remember, with the same sense of community and purpose. The faculty and staff are just as committed as ever to helping you succeed.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Second, I think it is also important to keep you apprised of the impacts the state budget cuts will have on your educational experience. At this point, I can do so in a general way. Many budget decisions are still being made and planning will continue even after the semester begins.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">You will be sent frequent updates and information from various offices on campus. It is more vital than ever that you pay close attention to messages sent to your HSU email &#8212; which is how our official information is distributed.  In addition, you can find more details about our budget situation, including the latest updates and announcements, at the HSU Budget Office website <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~budget/" style="color: #546a38;">www.humboldt.edu/~budget</a>.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Broadly speaking, the 23-campus California State University system is dealing with a $564 million state budget shortfall this year. The system's state funding of $1.6 billion is nearly $600 million lower than a decade ago, and we have quite a few more students now than we did then. It is a severe and unprecedented reduction in funding, and I know I am not alone in thinking it unfair and shortsighted. I'm particularly concerned about the long-term impact on California as we begin reducing enrollment by turning away qualified students.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The large fee increase you are paying is part of the CSU response to the severe budget cuts. Another is the two furlough days per month that most campus employees &#8212; including faculty, staff and administrators &#8212; will be taking this year. That amounts to a nearly 10 percent reduction in pay, which is a personal sacrifice for many.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">At Humboldt State, our state budget before the cuts was $102 million, and our shortfall before the recent fee increase was $15 million. The fee increase brought us $2.8 million and the furloughs save about $6.2 million, which means we still have a shortfall of $6 million. Just as at our sister campuses in the CSU and at the campuses in the University of California system, this leaves us with very difficult decisions.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We have known for some time that the national and state economic troubles would lead to serious budget cuts this year. Many months ago, we began taking steps such as deferring equipment purchases, freezing non-essential new hires, and limiting travel, and these measures are continuing. We planned for a large reduction throughout the spring and over the summer. However, we were significantly delayed by the fast-changing financial and political situation in California. The Legislature and Governor did not agree on a final budget until very recently.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We have since taken a number of additional steps, and will be taking many more throughout the semester.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">One thing we are doing is taking a serious look at all of our support programs and academic programs. We are determining if they can operate more efficiently, if they can become smaller and still be effective, if they can be consolidated with other programs, or if they need to be eliminated.  Just recently, this process led us to make the decision to close our Natural History Museum in Arcata &#8212; a wonderful resource for the community and the campus that we simply could no longer justify funding.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">As I mentioned, we are also not filling many positions. There are now many vacant positions in offices that provide student support services, and so you will very likely experience delays getting help or answers to questions. Despite our best intentions, lines will be longer. This will be exacerbated by campus furlough days, when our staff and administrators will not be at work except in limited cases such as public safety.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Many of you have already experienced class sections being eliminated after you registered. To some extent, this happens every year based on enrollment. However, this year more classes are being cancelled because too few students are enrolled. Other classes are also being cancelled if they do not lead to a degree, and departments are being asked to make class substitutions to help students continue progressing. You will notice that class sizes will generally be larger.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">In addition, new students signing up in the last orientation program, which is later next week, will be initially limited to 13 units. Our goal is to ensure that enough classes remain to allow all of these students to sign up for a full-time schedule. Later, we will re-open registration for additional units, and this group will have the first opportunity to register.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We also moved our 2009 summer session to our Extended Education program, and classes held over the summer were not paid for partially by the state.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Looking forward, we will need to be much more strategic about all of our programs and services.  In recent years, Humboldt State has focused on improving our effectiveness and efficiency through the <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/wasc/" style="color: #546a38;">WASC (the Western Association of Schools and Colleges) accreditation process</a>, the work of the Cabinet for Institutional Change and similar activities. These efforts will continue to be important as we make budget reductions and strive to position Humboldt State for the future.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Again, I am only able to provide an overview of the serious budget cuts being made this year. More details about the impacts, as well as guidance about specific actions you may need to take, will be communicated to you. We will do our very best to keep you informed, and we ask that you make sure to watch for university messages in your HSU email.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">As difficult as these budget cuts are, I remain confident that Humboldt State will rise to the occasion and you will continue to enjoy an extraordinary college experience. HSU is an amazing place, a community of people who care a great deal about making our world better and who are committed to higher education. It is filled with faculty and staff who care deeply about students, and with students who inspire with their talents and enthusiasm. I have always felt it to be a great privilege to be associated with this institution.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">You have my best wishes for an enjoyable and successful year at Humboldt State.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,</p>
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Rollin C. Richmond<br />President</p>
