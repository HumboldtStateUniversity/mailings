					  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Colleagues,</p> 

					       						       	
					       	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Another successful academic year is coming to a close at Humboldt State University. Final exams are nearly completed, and in just a couple days we will once again celebrate our graduates at Commencement ceremonies.</p> 
					       	
					       	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">It is an exciting time, and also a time to reflect on the importance of what we all do, together, for our students. I know they are forever changed by their experience at HSU. They grow intellectually and discover much about themselves; they learn to think more critically and to care more deeply about the world. We all share in their success, and I remain enormously proud to be part of this community.</p>
					       	
					       	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">I want to thank you for your hard work and dedication over the last year. It is true that we have had many challenges, and we all know that public higher education faces more difficult times in the coming years. But our day-to-day work is filled with rewards, with the positive experience of being part of something we believe in. We have a shared commitment to our students, and every day our efforts make a real difference.</p>
					       	
					       	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">I congratulate our Academic Senate for the hard and creative work that they have done over the past year to restructure our shared governance system.  I am also most appreciative that a majority of our faculty voted to adopt a University Senate model following the recommendations of the Cabinet for Institutional Change.   The Academic Senate will be working next Fall to resolve concerns and interpretations of existing documents and hopefully will move us to the University Senate model.  I am hopeful that these changes will allow us to address some of the criticisms of the WASC reaccreditation team and make the campus even stronger as we learn to work closely together on common goals.</p> 
					       	
					       	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">The Vice Presidents and I met recently with the Change Steering Committee to discuss their recommendations for our university priorities for the coming year.  We are proposing that we focus next year on retaining and graduating the students that we attract to the university.  We also will emphasize doing a better job of communicating with you and our students and working to involve more faculty and staff in the governance of the campus. We have a longstanding commitment to social and environmental responsibility, so let's pursue new and innovative ways to integrate these values into our curriculum as well as the way we manage our campus. We also plan to work with you to help transform those courses that are most difficult for our students and thereby improve the success especially of our underrepresented students.</p>  
					       	
					       	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">I look forward to discussing these topics more broadly during the fall semester, in addition to other important topics such as developing new revenue sources and considering more efficient ways to serve our students and faculty.</p>
					       	
					       	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Once again, thank you for all your efforts on behalf of HSU and our students.</p>
