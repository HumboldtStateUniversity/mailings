					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Dear Students and Colleagues:</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Professor Greg Crawford has been named the Dean of Science and Technology at Vancouver Island University in his native Canada. Greg's departure is a great loss for Humboldt State University. He has chaired the WASC Steering Committee for us and has done an excellent job in helping to shepherd the WASC review process. He also has been a productive member of the Oceanography department and he will surely be missed. Please join me in thanking him for his good work and wishing him and his family all the best in their new life.</p> 
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">It is with pleasure that I inform you that I have appointed Professor Rob Van Kirk, Mathematics, as the new chair of the WASC Steering Committee. Dr. Van Kirk has been an effective member of the Steering Committee for some time and is very familiar with the issues we face. Please wish him and his colleagues success with their important endeavor on behalf of our university.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Rollin C. Richmond<br>President</p>
