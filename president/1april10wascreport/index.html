					<tr>               
						<td class="mainbar" align="center" valign="top" style="padding: 22px 0 0 14px; text-align: left;">
							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Colleagues:</p> 
							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">We have recently received the formal report of the Visiting Team regarding our Educational Effectiveness Review, the third phase of our reaffirmation of accreditation by WASC (Western Association of Schools and Colleges). </p>

							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">The full report, prepared by the team that visited campus in early February, is available on our WASC website at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/wasc" title="Many voices. One vision." style="color: #476a31; text-decoration: underline;">www.humboldt.edu/wasc</a>. WASC will make a formal decision about the final terms of our continued accreditation at its meeting this summer.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">The report makes a number of positive observations about HSU's efforts to improve. It commends HSU for taking the accreditation process seriously and for seeing it as an important opportunity. At the same time, the team cautions that many initiatives are still in their early stages, and they urge us to see them through. This outside perspective will be valuable as we work to address our challenges and make HSU an even better institution for our students.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Of particular value is the report's conclusion, which is below. Each of the four commendations corresponds to a recommendation, and there is an additional overall recommendation.</p>

							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;"><strong>Commendations</strong></p> 

							<p  style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">1. Humboldt State University has used the WASC CPR and EER to improve its understanding of the need for assessment of student learning outcomes at multiple levels and has taken some steps along the path of assessing learning outcomes and using the results of these assessments for teaching and institutional improvement.</p>

														<p  style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">2. HSU's continuing efforts to make excellence inclusive are impressive, including demonstrating various activities to enhance the experience of traditionally underrepresented populations and employing thoughtful methods to collect, compile, and utilize assessment data for educational effectiveness. </p>

														<p  style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">3. At the suggestion of consultants, HSU has embraced several new initiatives, including the establishment of a Cabinet for Institutional Change. The Cabinet's work on the University's vision, campus governance, student success, a culture of evidence, upholding standards of transparency, and the effort to create a new era of collegiality and civil discourse, show promise for a positive renewal of HSU. </p>

														<p  style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">4. HSU conducted a credible academic program prioritization process to help with resource decisions that will have to be made in the future. </p>

														<p  style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;"><strong>Recommendations</strong> </p>

														<p  style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">1. HSU should continue to move from building capacity and frameworks for assessment to assessment of learning at all levels &ndash; course, program, and institution &ndash; and use assessment of learning outcomes routinely to improve curricula (including general education), teaching, and learning, as well as in other areas of decision-making, including resource allocations. </p>

														<p  style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">2. Although HSU has collected data on making excellence inclusive, it has not produced meaningful and sustainable results across the campus. In light of that, HSU should make more progress in enrolling and graduating students from historically underrepresented groups at a level that is more proportionate to percentages in the state's population, and demonstrate better progress in addressing the finding that ethnic minority students feel isolated, uncomfortable, unsupported, and academically marginalized. </p>

														<p  style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">3. HSU must embrace institutional change and make crucial choices in order to meet its mission and address the CPR and EER commitments. It should continue to employ the Cabinet for Institutional Change to focus HSU's mission and vision, to create shared understandings, to create clear structures of governance, to communicate well and with mutual respect in an effort to improve. </p>

														<p  style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">4. HSU should take the work of the prioritization process to its logical conclusion in decisions about resource allocations. </p>

														<p  style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">5. The 2008 CPR visit, 2008 WASC Commission letter, and consultant's report all suggest that HSU has a record of finding ways to avoid hard decisions and failing to complete initiatives. The University should be held accountable to complete the good work it has begun in connection with the WASC accreditation process.</p>

I am also grateful to the teams that prepared WASC materials and visits, an effort led by Vice Provost Jen&aacute; Burges and two different chairs of our WASC steering committee: former HSU Professor Greg Crawford and Professor Rob Van Kirk.</p>
