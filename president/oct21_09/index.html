							<p><strong>Dear Campus Community:</strong></p> 
						   

												<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">This is a sad day for Humboldt State University.</p>

														<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Early this morning we learned that Wayne Knight, a professor in the Art Department, died at Mad River Community Hospital after being hospitalized for a number of days. We have lost a friend and dedicated professor who will be sorely missed.</p>
														<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">A number of individuals from our campus have been in close contact with Professor Knight's family, and we have conveyed heartfelt condolences on behalf of the University. I ask that you keep his family in your thoughts in the days to come.</p>
														<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">I know that there are many of Professor Knight's students and colleagues who are deeply affected by this loss. Please know that the Humboldt community is here to support you in any way we can. In particular, counseling is available to students through the Counseling and Psychological Services (826-3236) and to faculty and staff through the Employee Assistance Program (443-7358).</p>
													   
							  <p style="padding: 4px 0px;">							
								At this time, I am not able to provide you with details about possible memorial services or Professor Knight's illness. We will remain in contact with his family, and will share more information when we are able.</p> 
								<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,</p>
								<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Rollin Richmond<br />President</p>
