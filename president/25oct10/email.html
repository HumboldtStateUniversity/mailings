							<td class="mainbar" align="center" valign="top" style="padding: 22px 0 0 14px; text-align: left;">
								<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Campus Community,</p> 
								<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">As you have probably heard, a student was sexually assaulted and several other students were assaulted by a lone suspect in the residence halls early Sunday morning. The suspect, who is not a student, was arrested by campus police shortly after the initial emergency calls. Paramedics responded to the scene and treated those injured, but no one was hospitalized. </p>
								<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">&raquo; <a href="http://now.humboldt.edu/news/incident-in-residence-halls-ends-with-suspect-arrested/" title="Incident in Residence Halls ends with Suspect Arrested - Humboldt State Now" style="color: #476a31; text-decoration: underline;">More information about the incident</a></p>

								<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">This was a shocking and frightening incident for our students and staff who survived this trauma. It has also been an emotionally difficult situation for many other students who live in the residence halls, as well as for staff in Housing. Although the suspect is in custody, their sense of security and safety has been shaken.</p>

															<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Our focus now is on restoring the community for the students who live in the residence halls as well as others across campus. We are continuing to check in with residents to offer counseling and academic assistance, and many will need ongoing support from across campus. I urge you to provide both understanding and guidance for any student who appears to be struggling in classes or extracurricular activities, and that you refer students to the Counseling Center for assistance.</p>

																													<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Counseling is available through the Counseling Center on the second floor of the Health Center. Call 826-3236 or <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/counseling/" title="Counseling & Psychological Services: Welcome" style="color: #476a31; text-decoration: underline;">visit the website</a>. In addition, staff from the Counseling Center will be available to meet with residents this evening, Oct. 25, at the following times and locations:</p>  
	<ul style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 30px; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">																											   <li>7:30 p.m. at College Creek in the Great Hall room on the 2nd floor of the Community Center.</li>
	<li>8 p.m. in the Klamath River room on the 2nd floor of the Jolly Giant Commons.</li>
	</ul>																												<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Two community meetings to give students a chance to talk about the incident have been scheduled for this evening, Oct. 25:</p> 
	<ul style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 30px; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">       																											<li>6 p.m. in the Klamath River room on the 2nd floor of the Jolly Giant Commons.</li>
	<li>7 p.m. in the Sunset Classroom on the 1st floor of Sunset Hall.</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">You might also find it helpful to review and share an excellent overview of <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/housing/current/safety.html" title="Housing + Dining - Current Residents - Resident Safety" style="color: #476a31; text-decoration: underline;">personal safety practices</a>, which is provided on the Housing website.</p>

	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Campus police are continuing their investigation of this incident. They continue to seek and interview witnesses to the assaults, and persons with information who have not yet spoken to UPD should call 826-5555.  </p>

	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">At the same time, we are reviewing security and access procedures in the residence halls. Safety and security is always a top priority, and if there is more that can be done to make our residence halls and the rest of campus safe, we will do it. </p>

	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Finally, on behalf of the entire campus community, I would like to extend gratitude to the many heroes from this weekend. Students and staff in the residence halls helped protect each other in a difficult situation, and continue to offer support to one another. Police officers from campus and the city of Arcata responded quickly, located the suspect and arrested him. Individuals from across campus have been working tirelessly to respond to student needs since the early morning incident. Thank you to all of you.</p>

	<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Sincerely,</p>
