          Building community connections is crucial to the success of Humboldt State University. We are focused on this, and in the last several months we have done much to strengthen our ties with College of the Redwoods and its President, Keith Flamer.
        </mj-text>
        <mj-text>
          There has always been a close relationship between CR and HSU, but until recently there was no formal agreement between the two. I was honored to sign a memorandum of understanding with President Flamer that will lead to collaboration on joint academic programs, admissions, intercollegiate athletics, university housing, campus safety, and more.
        </mj-text>
        <mj-text>
          We are already making good headway, working closely to develop HSU's new RN-to-BSN nursing program, and creating a new agreement to share library resources. CR recently added three degree pathways that will prepare students in Social Justice, Environmental Science, and Social Work and Human Services to attend HSU and other four-year schools.
        </mj-text>
        <mj-text>
          It's all part of our commitment to prepare local high school students for college success. They, in turn, will improve our region's economy, culture, and quality of life.
        </mj-text>
        <mj-text>
          In addition to CR, we are partnering with local tribes to ensure their young people have access to a four-year education and the resources to help them succeed. In November, we hosted representatives from many tribal nations on campus for a very meaningful day of discussions.
        </mj-text>
        <mj-text>
          And in December, more than 400 high school students representing 30 tribal affiliations visited campus to learn about education opportunities and the HSU experience. I'm eager to welcome many of them next year as new students at Humboldt State University.
