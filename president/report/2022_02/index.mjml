        <mj-text>While we are rapidly moving in the spring semester, I would like to take a moment to reflect on  hosting our first ever Fall Commencement, which was a resounding success and reminder that we're here for our students first. It was a great way to end 2021 and the new year has brought some exciting news for the University.

          As you're now well aware, we've been designated California's third polytechnic University, Cal Poly Humboldt. It's more than a historic momentâ€”it's a huge opportunity for all of our students, staff and faculty, our communities on the North Coast, and California. Learn more about what it means to be a polytechnic university here.

          I'm immensely grateful to everyone for your contributions to this effort. Our self-study and prospectus were conducted quickly under challenging circumstances, and they spotlighted our incredible strengths and areas for growth. Students, staff, faculty, alumni, donors, and community members were all integral to our success, and we will continue to seek input from and participation as we transition into a full polytechnic university.

        Alongside our campus' hard polytech work, we've made great strides in sustainability efforts. Sustainability at Cal Poly Humboldt is not just an initiative, but a culture. The <a href="https://facilitymgmt.humboldt.edu/sustainability-what-sustainability" class="dark">definition</a> of sustainability touches on a wide variety of programs and populations, with the intent of achieving the university's sustainability goals and educating our students to be ambassadors of sustainability.

            <li style="padding-bottom:14px;"><strong>Climate Action Plan</strong>: We are updating the ClimateAction Plan (CAP 2.0) and we want your input! The CAP 2.0 is a roadmap to guide the university towards achieving carbon neutrality by 2045, and to build resilience to climate change impacts. </li>
            <li style="padding-bottom:14px;"><strong>STARS</strong>: The campus has completed a plan to pursue a platinum rating in a large and well-adopted sustainability assessment called STARS. This ambitious goal will position the campus to become the best performing CSU in the system by 2026, and one of very few campuses worldwide to secure the elusive Platinum rating. Read the <a href="https://facilitymgmt.humboldt.edu/sites/default/files/hsu_stars_path_to_platinum_2020-2022_final.pdf" class="dark">Path to Platinum Plan here</a>. A few examples of current programming underway that supports this effort includes professional development for faculty on sustainability topics, refining our process for designating courses as sustainability focused or related, better documenting landscape management and integrated pest management protocols, and incorporating sustainability criteria more formally into contracts and procurement policy.

            <li style="padding-bottom:14px;"><strong>Microgrid</strong>: The University has partnered with the Schatz Energy Research Center to develop a campus microgrid. A microgrid is a system of energy generation, storage, and controls that will provide electricity to campus in the event the grid goes down and to lower the university's electricity demand. Components will include solar PV, large battery, backup generator, and associated controls. Local microgrids developed by the Schatz Center are at the <a href="https://schatzcenter.org/blrmicrogrid/" class="dark">Blue Lake Rancheria</a> and the <a href="https://schatzcenter.org/acv/" class="dark">Redwood Coast airport</a></li>
            <li style="padding-bottom:14px;"><strong>Social Justice in Sustainability</strong>: The Sustainability Office continues to work toward implementing a sustainability movement that elevates justice, liberation, and decolonization along with the environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability. A few programs underway for Spring 2022 include various book circles and speaker series, supporting Umoja's Black to the Land farming initiative at the Bayside Park Farm, and supporting a campus-wide food summit led by El Centro (and supported by HEIF) in April 2022. </li>
