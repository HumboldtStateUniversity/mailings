				<td class="mainbar" align="center" valign="top" style="padding: 22px 0 0 14px; text-align: left;">
					  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Colleagues and Students:</p>

					  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">It is with some sadness that I have arrived at my last day as President of Humboldt State University. It has been a great and wonderful privilege serving in this role.</p>

					  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">I would like to thank you and wish you all well for the future. I have a strong belief that President Rossbacher will continue and expand our efforts to ensure that our university serves its students, its faculty, its staff and its broader community very well.</p> 

					  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">I have been particularly fortunate to have been able to work with some excellent colleagues who have done much to improve our campus. The future looks bright. I am particularly grateful to the staff who worked in the President’s Office during my time here. They care deeply for the university, were loyal and supportive and most importantly, never hesitated to advise me when they thought I needed to reconsider a decision.</p> 

					  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">One of the things that I will miss most starting tomorrow is the ongoing opportunity to watch our students explore new ideas and assert themselves. Young people have a great capacity to question their elders’ values, judgments, analyses and perspectives on the world. Our students, more than any other campus where I have worked, have encouraged me to rethink my perspectives.</p> 

					  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Many of the important changes made at Humboldt over the years have been a result of student and faculty leadership. The Campus Center for Appropriate Technology is decades ahead of the current focus on environmental, social and economic sustainability. The Y.E.S. House (Youth Education Services) that does so much for our community and our students was also partly a student initiative. I am so proud of the accomplishments of the Humboldt Energy Independent Fund (HEIF), which students created and continue to support financially. HEIF not only is making progress in moving the campus towards energy independence, it also provides a wonderful opportunity for students, faculty and staff to work together on sustainability issues. And, of course, the student-initiated Graduation Pledge is now being adopted around the world and makes us all think about our social and environmental responsibilities. I have recently been bragging to other CSU campuses about our latest student initiative, Check It, which will help to reduce violence between individuals and especially sexual violence. Again, this is a student and faculty and staff initiative. Bravo all!</p>

					  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Humboldt State University is at the beginning of its next century, and I expect much to change even in the near future. Over the last few years we have seen much change in how we help students to learn and Humboldt State University is a leader in the use and adoption of technological approaches. I hope that continues and expands, and that we continue to work with our K-12 colleagues to help them use these technologies too. One of the things that I hope does not change is our tradition of students, faculty and staff working together to develop initiatives to improve our world. </p>

					  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">I look forward to watching the university grow and change for the better. It has been a real pleasure - most of the time - to serve as a leader of this campus. I have grown intellectually and emotionally over my years here and will do all I can in retirement to continue to help our campus. </p>

					  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Thank you for all you have done, and will do, to provide an excellent educational opportunity for our students and service to our community. As Nelson Mandela said, “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”</p>
