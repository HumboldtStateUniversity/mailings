		<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Faculty, Staff and Students:</p> 
		<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">We have just received the final decision from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) on the reaccreditation of Humboldt State University. The letter from WASC is available on the universityâ€™s <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/wasc/docs/WASCJuly142010Response.pdf" style="color: #476a31; text-decoration: none;">WASC website</a>. I am pleased to report that HSU has been reaccredited, as expected, until the 2019 academic year.  At the end of the 2019/20 academic year, the university and WASC will have completed another reaccreditation review that will begin in 2015/16 academic year.  WASC has also requested that we provide an interim report to them in November of 2013 that will present information on our efforts to assess student learning, student success/inclusive excellence, campus culture and the re-alignment of our resources.  This whole process has been most useful for our university, and I believe that the request for an additional report in 2013 will provide the incentive we need to continue our progress to make the changes that WASC and our Cabinet for Institutional Change have identified as important for the continuing success of HSU.</p>

In particular, I acknowledge the leadership and work of former HSU Professor Greg Crawford, Professor Robert Van Kirk, Vice Provost Jen&aacute; Burges, and Provost Snyder.  They led the effort effectively, kept the various working groups on track and helped me in my dealings with the WASC groups.</p>

The ultimate test of all these efforts, however, will be their sustainability over time. Related to and dependent upon sustainability is the question of results: what will actually be accomplished through this transformation in the next three to five years? In the words of the team, "efficacy&hellip;will be demonstrated only when sound decisions are made based on the evidence gathered." This recommendation sets an excellent agenda for us for the next few years.  I am confident that we can achieve the goals that WASC has set for us and continue to provide outstanding educational opportunities for the people of California and beyond.  I thank you all for your prior support of these initiatives and will look forward to working with you in the future to realize our goals.
