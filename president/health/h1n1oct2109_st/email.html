					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Students,</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The campus has received confirmation that Art Professor Wayne Knight's death earlier this morning was due to complications brought on by H1N1 (swine) flu. His death is a terrible loss for our campus community. It is also an important reminder of the need to take H1N1 seriously.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">This past week the Student Health Center has seen a significant increase in the number of students who are ill with H1N1 flu. Nationwide and locally, most people suffer from a few days of illness and recover uneventfully.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;"><strong>However, some individuals have become quite ill with pneumonia following their initial illness.</strong></p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;"><strong>This disease, which is mostly mild, can affect some individuals rapidly and severely. It is important that seriously ill people seek treatment promptly.</strong></p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">1.	If you have flu symptoms and would like advice, call the Student Health Center at 826-3146 or the after hours Nurse Response line at (866) 724-5057. You will speak with medical personnel who will tell you if you need to be examined or will give you advice if not. Symptoms include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>fever (though not everyone gets a fever with this flu)</li>
						<li>cough</li>
						<li>sore throat</li>
						<li>runny or stuffy nose</li>
						<li>body aches</li>
						<li>headache</li>
						<li>chills</li>
						<li>fatigue</li>
						<li>sometimes diarrhea and vomiting</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">2.	If you have flu symptoms and an underlying health condition, call your doctor, the Student Health Center, or see a medical provider early in the illness to be assessed for possible anti-viral medication. It is important to start medications early. Underlying conditions could include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Pregnancy</li>
						<li>Cancer</li>
						<li>Blood disorders (including sickle cell disease)</li>
						<li>Chronic lung disease [including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)]</li>
						<li>Diabetes</li>
						<li>Heart disease</li>
						<li>Kidney disorders</li>
						<li>Liver disorders</li>
						<li>Neurological disorders (including nervous system, brain or spinal cord)</li>
						<li>Neuromuscular disorders (including muscular dystrophy and multiple sclerosis)</li>
						<li>Weakened immune systems (including people with AIDS)</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">3.	If your symptoms are not improving in 3-4 days, or if at any time they suddenly worsen, or if you have any warning signs listed below, seek medical care immediately:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath</li>
						<li>Pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen</li>
						<li>Sudden dizziness</li>
						<li>Confusion</li>
						<li>Severe or persistent vomiting</li>
					</ul>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Also, counseling is available for students who need support in dealing with the loss of Professor Knight. Contact Counseling and Psychological Services at 826-3236.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,</p>

					Director, Student Health and Counseling</p>
