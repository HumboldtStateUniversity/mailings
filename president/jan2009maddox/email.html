					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Colleagues,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">During the fall semester, Maddox Management Consulting carried out an extensive review of the campus budget process and developed recommendations for improvement. The goal was to make the process simpler, more transparent and, ultimately, more effective.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Maddox has completed and submitted a final report, which is available online at  <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~wasc/docs/maddox/maddoxReport.pdf" style="color: #687819;">http://www.humboldt.edu/~wasc/docs/maddox/maddoxReport.pdf</a>. This final report includes a series of telling observations and contains a number of suggestions for process improvement.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We as a campus community are responsible for using our best judgment about the use of scarce resources, and no amount of process improvement will make that simple. However, my hope is that improvements to the process will generate more trust across campus and lead to a campus community more able to work together to make strategic budget decisions.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">In coming months, I will be reviewing the Maddox recommendations with the Provost and Vice Presidents, Academic Senate, President's Council, key budget staff and others. I am confident that this will lead to many of the recommendations being implemented, and I will keep you informed as major changes are made.</p>
