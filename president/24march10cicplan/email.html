								<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">Dear Colleagues,</p>

								<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">As I reported to you earlier, the Cabinet for Institutional Change issued a report in February (available at <a href="http://change.humboldt.edu/" title="Cabinet for Institutional Change - Humboldt State University" style="color: #546a38; text-decoration: none;">http://change.humboldt.edu/</a>) that has been endorsed by the Academic Senate, the Associated Students, the Staff Council and the University Executive Committee. It was recommended that we establish a Steering Committee to track the progress of the implementation of the Cabinet's recommendations and report regularly to the campus. My office has consulted with these groups and has identified the following individuals to serve on the steering committee:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Professor John Meyer, Department of Politics (Chair)</li>
									<li>Kristy Eden, Student</li>
									<li>Adrienne Colegrove-Raymond, Student Academic Services Outreach and Educational Talent Search</li>
									<li>Professor Mary Glenn, Department of Anthropology</li>
									<li>Denice Helwig, Office of the President</li>
									<li>Professor Scott Paynton, Department of Communication</li>
									<li>Philip Rouse, Business Services</li>
								</ul> 

			  					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">This group will begin its work immediately. </p>

			  											<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">In addition, we are creating a new steering committee focused on technology and learning. This follows a series of campus presentations on affordable learning solutions by Dr. Gerry Hanley from the Chancellor's Office. He suggested creating a steering committee to ensure that the various entities on campus work effectively together to educate faculty and staff about what is possible using new technologies. Specifically, he focused on technology's potential to increase the affordability of higher education, to promote environmental responsibility, to better engage students in learning, and to promote the development of online education. </p>

			  											<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">This group will augment the work already being done on campus by some of our faculty and help to ensure that the best approaches are widely known. They will work to increase faculty understanding of the value of using technology in their courses and celebrate the achievements of faculty who are using technology creatively. I have sought recommendations of individuals from all campus governance groups, and the following individuals have agreed to serve:</p>     
			<ul>
				<li>Aaron Wilyer, Student</li>
				<li>Gretchen Keer, Library</li>
				<li>Joan Van Duzer, Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching</li>
				<li>Shawn Korman, Instructional Technology Services</li>
				<li>Kevin O'Brien, Student Disability Resource Center (Chair)</li>
				<li>Linda Thompson, Bookstore</li>
				<li>Professor Marcy Burstiner, Department of Journalism and Mass Communication</li>
				<li>Professor Kathy Munoz, Department of Kinesiology and Recreation</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">This group will begin its work immediately. </p>

				<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Please join me in thanking our colleagues and our students for their willingness to serve on these important groups that will help to move the university forward.</p>


								<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,<br/> <br/>

								Rollin C. Richmond  <br/>
								President</p>
