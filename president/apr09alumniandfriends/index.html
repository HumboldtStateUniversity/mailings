					<p style="padding: 3px 0px;">Alumni and Friends,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Many of you have recently shared concerns about budget cuts at Humboldt State and the rest of the California State University system, and you've told me how difficult it can be to understand the real impact. I thought you would be interested in an article about these cuts that recently appeared in the Wall Street Journal.</p>

						<p><strong>Budget Woes Take Their Toll on Cal State University System</strong><br />
						By Jim Carlton</p>
						
						<p>SAN FRANCISCO &#8212; Relentless budget cutting by California lawmakers is taking some of the luster off the California State University system, one of the state's most prized institutions.</p>
						
						<p>Once regarded as a national model, the 23-campus system is reeling from more than $500 million in budget cuts and underfunding over the past two years.</p>
					</blockquote>
						
					<p style="padding: 2px 0px; font-size: .9em;"><em>Full story: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123897041442890795.html" style="color: #546a38;">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123897041442890795.html</a></em></p>

					<p style="padding: 8px 0px 4px 0px;">Obviously, this isn't the kind of attention we hope to get from the national media. But when the Wall Street Journal runs a story on the CSU budget, things are serious. The cuts we've made, and the cuts we're facing, will have a lasting impact on our campuses, and more importantly, on California's future.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">I'm particularly dismayed that our university system has been forced to turn away students. For the second year in a row, CSU campuses are turning away 10,000 qualified students &#8212; breaking faith with a group of young people who had done all we asked of them.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">This is a difficult time for our state and nation. We're in the midst of a financial crisis the likes of which we haven't seen for decades, and families and businesses are struggling. But I also know that California's public universities are an opportunity for our young people and an engine for our economy that we cannot neglect. Our future prosperity depends on making their college dreams a reality.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">At Humboldt State, we're making tough choices as we work to preserve the special character of this University and limit cuts that directly impact student learning. Like many CSU campuses, we've delayed or cancelled equipment purchases, held off filling many open positions and eliminated others, delayed building maintenance, and more. Our Provost has led an important process of prioritization of our academic programs, and has made a number of difficult choices that will save money going forward. In addition, faculty members are working to bring more grants to campus, and alumni and friends like you have been giving in record numbers.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">However, I worry that cuts could become too deep, hampering our ability to either prepare for the future or meet the needs of today's students. I hope you share my concerns, as well as my affection for Humboldt State and the unique experience we offer our students. There are many ways you can help, and I'd ask that you do whatever you can.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">One thing you can do is advocate for us. We need those who care about Humboldt State to tell their friends, neighbors and co-workers about this University and the importance of public higher education. Elected officials need to hear from you as well, and you can use our advocacy website to find them as well as to keep up with current issues affecting our campus. It is at <a href="http://humboldt.kintera.org" style="color: #546a38;">http://humboldt.kintera.org</a>.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We also need your continued financial support. It has become increasingly clear in recent years that the state simply will not provide enough funding to support the kind of academic experience that defines Humboldt State. Our alumni, along with parents and families of current students, have been remarkably willing to help, and I ask you to continue doing so. You can make a gift online or learn more about giving programs at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/giving" style="color: #546a38;">www.humboldt.edu/giving</a>.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Thank you for your continuing support and encouragement. Together, we can ensure that Humboldt State continues to provide an extraordinary, life-shaping experience for future generations of students.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,</p>
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Rollin C. Richmond<br />President<br />Humboldt State University</p>
