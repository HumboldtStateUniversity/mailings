Many people worked over the summer to plan and implement these initiatives.  These efforts are summarized below.</p>

<p style="color:#585858;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:13px;margin-right:0;margin-left:0;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-right:0;padding-left:0;line-height:20px;font-size:14px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" >This work aligns directly with Humboldt State University’s mission, vision, values, and strategic goals.  One of our four primary strategic goals is to “Foster meaningful relationships across differences, including diverse cultural communities, identities, and competencies,” with the specific objective to “Ensure that diverse perspectives, identities, and communities are acknowledged and taught throughout the curriculum and provide a safe environment for everyone to explore a broad range of viewpoints and ideas.”</p>

<p style="color:#585858;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:13px;margin-right:0;margin-left:0;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-right:0;padding-left:0;line-height:20px;font-size:14px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" >The murder of David Josiah Lawson last April has been a catalyst for driving needed change in our community.  Evidence of the commitment to action includes open letters that were signed by hundreds of faculty and staff in May and June. These letters called for educational workshops on microaggressions, implicit bias, bystander intervention, and keynote speakers to stimulate our awareness of the need for, and discussion about, an inclusive and supportive environment at HSU.  This work in our region is connected to issues that are affecting communities throughout the United States. HSU joins colleges and universities across the nation in condemning the violence and hatred demonstrated in the recent white supremacy protests in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p>

<p style="color:#585858;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:13px;margin-right:0;margin-left:0;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-right:0;padding-left:0;line-height:20px;font-size:14px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" >On July 12, 2017, a group of about 65 people gathered to spend the day working on actions to be taken in the upcoming weeks and months.  In addition to HSU faculty, staff, students, and administrators, and elected and appointed officials from the City of Arcata, sectors represented at the meeting included the business community, K-12 education, College of the Redwoods, non-profit organizations, the faith community, and local residents.  “Equity Arcata” has grown out of this gathering, with a focus on integrating University and City efforts and supporting the wide variety of activities that are underway across the region.  A website is being developed that will provide a link to the initiatives, groups, updates, and available information.  A summary of this meeting is <a style="color:#933621;" href="http://now.humboldt.edu/news/meeting-on-racism-and-safety-unites-arcata">included here</a>.</p>
