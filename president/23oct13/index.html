					  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Colleagues</p>
					  
<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">A characteristic that describes the people of Humboldt is their commitment to work together for the benefit of the entire community. One of the ways that we help each other, especially those who have had some personal challenges, is to contribute to local non-profit organizations of our choice.  It is my pleasure to help kick off the 2013 California State Employees Charitable Campaign (CSECC) at Humboldt State University. We join together in association with other State organizations throughout Humboldt County who are being invited to participate in this important fund drive. In addition to this letter, you will be receiving pledge forms from University Co-Chairs Lura Holtkamp and Taylor Baker (Provost's Office) who will be available to answer any questions you have pertaining to this pledge drive.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Through the annual CSECC Campaign, you may designate your gift to any specific non-profit charitable organization on your pledge form. A list of non-profit organizations is available online through <a href="http://www.csecc.org" title="California State Employees Charitable Campaign" style="color:#476a31;">www.csecc.org</a> and/or available in the hardcopy CSECC Campaign booklet.  Our regional United Way is one of those non-profit options.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">United Way, on behalf of the State Board of Control, assists in the managing of the CSECC campaign in the Humboldt/Del Norte County region. Our local United Way is now a part of United Way of the Wine Country (UWWC), which encompasses 5 northern regions -Humboldt, Del Norte, Sonoma, Mendocino, &amp; Lake Counties.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">United Way collaborates and partners with many local agencies, which provide a broad spectrum of services to our community, for our friends and neighbors, and in some instances, our own faculty, staff and students. This year several United Way initiatives can directly benefit students, supporting our focus on HSU student success.  They are:</p>
<ul style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 30px; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">
<li>2-1-1 Humboldt &ndash; offers expanded resource and referral services available 24 hours/7 days a week for any “non-emergency call” for anyone living in Humboldt County.  Trained Call Center specialists assist callers in finding resources to fit their needs and screen for eligibility for special programs, such as VITA, Cal Fresh, Women &amp; Children's Fund, Housing, etc.</li>
<li>VITA (Voluntary Income Tax Assistance) program provides free tax preparation, access to eligible tax credits and referrals to health and human services. Anyone earning less than $58,000 annually is eligible for VITA.</li>
<li>Outreach and Education for Covered California &ndash; a new community benefit to help Humboldt County's uninsured people (including students and entrepreneurs) get health insurance coverage or look at ways to reduce their insurance costs.</li>
<li>Opportunities to volunteer in the local community through Day of Caring, 2-1-1 Humboldt, VITA program, Covered California and other programs.</li>
</ul>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">If you choose to contribute, you may do so through our payroll deduction program, or you may make a donation by check. Many of you give generously in our community both through money as well as through service. Please consider increasing your monthly contribution this year. I have established a Presidential Level of giving at $750 per year. If you are not giving yet, consider making at least a $5 per week contribution. Please join me in making a significant difference in our community,</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">For me, it is less important how much you give but that you do give as you are able. Let's make this a record year for HSU in terms of the numbers of us who give something to our community through the CSECC campaign. Thank you!</p>
