				<td class="mainbar" align="center" valign="top" style="padding: 22px 0 0 14px; text-align: left;">
					  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Campus Community,</p>
					  
<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Please join me in congratulating the faculty award recipients for 2012-13, each of whom was recommended by the University Senate.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">They are: Professor Mark Colwell, Outstanding Professor; Professor Sing Chew, Scholar of the Year; Professor Kathleen Doty, Excellence in Teaching; and Lecturer Dan Aldag, Excellence in Teaching.</p>

<ul style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 30px; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">
	<li style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">Professor Colwell, Department of Wildlife, is recognized for "superlative teaching, mentoring, scholarship and creative activities" since arriving at Humboldt State in 1989. The Senate's Faculty Awards Committee said his near-quarter century of service "has had a lasting effect at HSU through his excellence in teaching and sustained scholarly activities." He is highly praised by students for sharing his passion for science and ecology. Colwell also received plaudits for his research in shorebird ecology, with an emphasis on conservation and management. He is the author of the book, <em>Shorebird Ecology, Conservation and Management</em>.</li>
	<li style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">Professor Chew, Department of Sociology, is honored for his research and scholarship in environmental degradation and ecological crisis. He joined Humboldt State in 1990 and developed a theoretical model of recurring dark ages, which he has applied to periods of socioeconomic change worldwide. His studies have included globalization's impact on world migration, urban shrinkage and citizenship. Chew has published seven books, 18 journal articles and book chapters and four encyclopedia entries, among other work. The Faculty Awards Committee lauded him as "a very productive scientist and an excellent teacher."</li>
	<li style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">Professor Doty, Department of English, regularly receives top teaching scores from students.  The Awards Committee highlighted her dedication, talent and commitment in presenting difficult material in linguistics and rhetoric. Many of Doty's current and former students, the Committee said, call her "the most influential professor they had during their college education" in teaching the politics of language and its impact on everyday life.</li>
	<li style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">Dan Aldag, Lecturer in the Department of Music, is honored for exceptional work with jazz ensembles, consistently high teaching scores and high standards. He has served HSU for nearly two decades. In the past five years, he has taught 26 different courses, ranging from large lecture general education to small activity courses. Students praise his passion, dedication, clarity and willingness to help.</li>
</ul>
