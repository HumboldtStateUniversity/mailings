								<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">Campus Community,</p>

								<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">This morning we began informing a number of campus staff and faculty that their positions are being reduced to 10- or 11-month appointments. This was a difficult decision, but one that was necessary given severe state budget cuts as well as mandated enrollment reductions.</p>

													<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">In all, this reduces the annual work hours for 71 staff members and 5 faculty librarians.</p>

													<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We did not take this action lightly. Dedicated, hard-working colleagues are being affected through no fault of their own. </p>

													<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Fortunately, we were able to avoid a situation in which people actually lost their jobs. Health benefits will not be impacted by the loss of work hours, but salaries will. I know this will be a hardship for these employees.</p>

													<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Administrators across campus will be discussing the situation with affected employees throughout the day. Human Resources staff and Academic Personnel Services staff are available to schedule meetings with employees to discuss their particular situations. In addition, our Employee Assistance Program is available to provide confidential support and can be contacted at 443-7358.</p>

													<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Because union contracts allow some employees up to one month to request a reassignment rather than a reduced assignment, we don't expect to know everyone who is affected by this change until the end of April.</p>

													<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">These timebase reductions are the direct result of drastic state budget cuts as well as the enrollment reductions those cuts have led to.</p>

													<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">HSU is being required to reduce enrollment by 6 percent as part of an overall enrollment reduction in the CSU system. To help achieve this, we have moved summer session to self-supported operation, and our summer session enrollment dropped to 531 students last year. That's less than half of the year before, and it reduces the need for some library and administrative support services during the summer.</p>

													<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">As for budget cuts, I believe everyone understands the challenge. We have endured many years of difficult budgets, and expect the next year to be difficult as well. This year, we're dealing with a reduction of over $12 million from our $102 million state budget. </p>

													<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Many efforts have been made at the system and campus level to limit the impact of these budget cuts on students and preserve as many jobs as possible. These include employee furloughs, required enrollment reductions and fee increases across the CSU system. At HSU, we have also reorganized many units, held open or eliminated vacant administrative and staff positions, cancelled many faculty searches, reduced spending on equipment and travel, and more. The reduction in work hours we are announcing today will save an estimated $750,000 annually.</p>

													<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">As I work with the Vice Presidents, Deans, University Budget Committee and others in shaping next year's budget, we remain focused on how we can best serve students, preserve jobs and ensure HSU is positioned to flourish as the economy recovers.</p>

								<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,<br/> <br/>

								Rollin Richmond  <br/>
								President</p>
