Please note F<strong>ebruary 13</strong> on your calendar and plan on joining the conversation.  This effort is important, as is this day.  We are shaping our collective future.  And the plan will provide the basis for the implementation that will follow, including the budget.</p>

The day-long workshop will be divided into three segments so that you will know when specific discussions will be happening and how you want to choose to participate.  Please join us for these interactive, World Café-style workshops where you can participate in small group conversations around tables of five.  The day will include a series of focused, topical sessions, designed for people to participate in specific activities – or to come and stay for the entire day. </p>
