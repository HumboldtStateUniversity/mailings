					<p style="padding: 5px 0px;">Dear Students,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Welcome back to the Spring Semester at Humboldt State University. I hope you had a relaxing holiday season and enjoyed your time with friends and loved ones.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Your return is always energizing for those of us who work here. The campus is much too quiet when you are away, and daily tasks aren't nearly as rewarding without a constant reminder of their importance.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Like all of us who work at Humboldt State, I'm excited to be a part of the many successes I know you will enjoy this semester. I look forward to seeing your art exhibits, learning from your latest research projects and watching you compete in athletic contests. I know I'll be inspired once more by your hard work on sustainability projects and in community service. Most especially, I am eager to shake your hands and wish you well during graduation ceremonies.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Humboldt State is a unique place. You chose to study here for many of the same reasons that I chose to work here. And I remain focused on strengthening those things that make it so extraordinary &#8212; personal interaction with faculty, hands-on learning, a close-knit campus community, and a commitment to environmental and social responsibility.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">There are, as always, challenges ahead. Our nation faces a complex financial crisis, one that has affected many of you in serious ways and one which will force Humboldt State to deal with challenging budgets in coming years. At the same time, HSU is in the midst of a reaccreditation process, which is the regular but difficult assessment that all universities must go through.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">On the budget, I don't know how the financial situation will be resolved. However, I'm confident that we will make it through this economic downturn and HSU will continue to be a university where students receive an excellent education for a very reasonable price. And I can promise you this: In all our planning and in all our decisions, your educational experience is our top priority.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">As for reaccreditation, I expect we will complete it sometime in 2010. In the meantime, we will be undergoing reviews by teams from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). We have already heard many positive comments, though there are also several areas where improvements are needed. These are primarily related to our internal procedures &#8212; how decisions are made and how we set strategic priorities. We need to improve in these areas to achieve important goals like implementing learning outcomes and achieving greater campus diversity.  It is very likely that our accreditation will be continued when this process is finished in 2010.  Until then and likely thereafter, HSU remains fully accredited.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Many of you are already playing a part in addressing these challenges through student government or as members of campus committees. That high level of student involvement is an important strength of Humboldt State, and I thank you for your efforts. If you are not already participating I urge you to do so. You can find ways to get involved by contacting Associated Students, your academic department or student groups. You can also contact my office at any time for advice and guidance.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Once again, welcome back. I wish you an enjoyable and successful Spring Semester.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Rollin Richmond<br />President</p>
