					  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Campus Community,</p>


<p  style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">In addition to HSU's annual evaluation process, each vice president participates in an administrative review process every three years.  The campus was notified of Vice President Peg Blake's review this academic year and invited to submit input.  This review has concluded and based on comments received and my own personal assessment, it is my opinion, and that of several of you who sent reviews, that we are fortunate to have Dr. Blake leading HSU's division of Enrollment Management and Student Affairs.  She is an administrator who puts the needs of our students first and appreciates and supports the vision of our campus.</p>

<p  style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Those of you who submitted reviews to my office (Thank you!) noted the following successes led by Dr. Blake:</p>
<ul style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 20px; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">
<li>She is very good at facilitating meetings and offers important insight on issues under consideration.</li>
<li>Dr. Blake is a team player who has restructured our student support programs in ways that are best for our students.</li>
<li>Peg brings national expertise to her division, takes a university perspective and is focused on the needs of students not what benefits her division.</li>
<li>Dr. Blake has moved the IRA Committee forward by broadening their perspective on university goals, simplifying the application process and changing policies and allocation of funds.</li>
<li>She led the effort to develop an enrollment management plan and has helped to identify and implement the adoption of new software for a number of ways to assist our students and advisors.</li>
<li>Dr. Blake led the implementation of the student portal, myHumboldt, as a means of better communicating important messages to students.</li>
<li>She led the investigation into â€˜early alert' software systems, and sponsored the implementation of MAP-Works for that purpose.</li>
<li>She serves as Chair of the CSU-wide Student Mental Health Advisory Committee.</li>
<li>She implemented an annual program assessment throughout the Division, as well as a 5-year departmental review by external reviewers to improve quality and promote best practices in all of our programs and services.</li>
<li>She has been very successful in recruiting new people to her division and welcomed the input from a variety of people.</li>
<li>Dr. Blake has a never-ending flow of concepts, ideas, projects, and programs.</li>
<li>She is very passionate about her work.</li>
<li>Dr. Blake will always take time to meet with students or help a staff member.</li>
<li>She is a constant voice for students and is guided by our mission of inclusive student success.</li>
</ul>
<p  style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">The administrative review form for Vice President Blake also requested advice about areas of her performance that could be strengthened. I have discussed these issues and this entire review with Dr. Blake and have identified the following goals for the next few years:</p>
<ul style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 20px; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">
	<li>Give your colleagues clear goals for their units, and then allow them to execute the changes that are needed. You do not need to be personally involved in so many decisions within your division. </li>
	<li>Learn to say no to requests that are not critical to your division.</li>
	<li>When difficult decisions are being discussed, step away from the current culture and critically evaluate the situation using your prior experience to determine the best course of action.</li>
	<li>Continue to consider experiments to improve success in the division.</li>
	<li>Continue work with Academic Affairs to increase student retention and graduation rates.</li>
	<li>Continue efforts to expand extracurricular opportunities for students.</li>
	<li>Work with Associated Students to attract strong candidates for elected and oversight positions.
	<li>Work with International Programs and Plant Operations to ensure that we have the academic and physical resources to be ever more attractive for international students.</li>
	<li>Examine the approaches to student recruitment with the goal of attracting and retaining more students and especially international students.</li>
</ul>

<p  style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">In my view, Peg is an important addition to the leadership of HSU.  She works well with the other vice presidents, co-workers and students.  Her leadership of national organizations is a most important way for knowledge of our campus to spread. Under Dr. Blake's leadership we are making real progress in improving our support for students and developing ways to improve our graduation and retention rates for all students.  I very much appreciate the attention she has brought to the use of technology to assist faculty and staff who advise our students.  Over the last decade, we have made real progress in diversifying our student population, and Dr. Blake and her colleagues have contributed to the important initiative.  I am most grateful to Vice President Blake for her focus on the needs of our students and willingness to adopt a university-wide perspective in her division.</p>
