					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;"><strong>State Will Not Receive Enough Stimulus Money; CSU to Get Reduction</strong></p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">California will not receive enough federal stimulus money to avoid $948 million in cuts to specific programs in the 2009-10 budget, including a $50 million reduction to the CSU's 2009-10 budget. A determination by the state treasurer and state finance director as to whether or not the state would receive a specified amount of the federal funds was one of the requirements that was included in the recently enacted state budget. The treasurer and finance director's March 27 decision means the cuts to specific programs will occur. It also means the personal income tax rates will increase by 0.25 percent rather than 0.125 percent. Overall, the decision preserves $2.8 billion of revenue on which the state budget depends. The $50 million reduction&#8212;while not welcome news&#8212;is not an unanticipated development. It has been understood to be a possibility since the state budget was passed in February. Given that the legislative analyst's office recently predicted that the current budget is already $8 billion short and likely to grow due to California's deteriorating economy, the CSU's emphasis is on persuading the legislature and governor to avoid further cuts.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;"><strong>Chancellor Emphasizes CSU's Impact on State's Economy to Legislators</strong></p>
										
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The California State University plays an essential role in providing skilled professionals for the state's workforce and is poised to help California's economy recover if the university is spared further cuts, CSU Chancellor Charles B. Reed told the Senate Budget Subcommittee at its hearing April 2. Reed appeared with University of California President Mark Yudof and California Community College Chancellor Jack Scott. Reed said the CSU graduates nearly 92,000 students each year and prepares the majority of California's workforce in the state's leading industries including agriculture, technology, entertainment, engineering and nursing. Reed, along with other CSU leaders, has testified before the Assembly and Senate committees to underscore the impact the CSU has on the state's economy and to make the case for adequate funding. State general fund support to the CSU was reduced in 2008-09 by $97.6 million below the previous year; $66.3 million of the cut was a permanent reduction to the CSU's base budget that will continue in 2009-10. CSU will receive another $50 million cut to its 2009-10 budget. "By 2025, the demand for skilled workers will outpace the supply of graduates with a bachelor's degree by 3 million people if we don't fund education in California," Reed said.</a></p>
