				<td class="mainbar" align="center" valign="top" style="padding: 22px 0 0 14px; text-align: left;">
					  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Campus Community,</p>
					  
<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Please join me in extending a warm welcome to our new Chancellor, Timothy P. White, when he visits our campus April 8 and 9. He will be joined by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Jessica Darin.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Chancellor White plans to visit each of the 23 CSU campuses and I am gratified that Humboldt State is among his first stops. This trip will be a chance for him to get acquainted with our campus, and he is eager to interact with as many of us as possible.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">The schedule includes an Open Forum for the campus community at 9:20 a.m., Tuesday, April 9 in Goodwin Forum. Professor Noah Zerbe of the Department of Politics has graciously agreed to host the forum and I hope many of you will be able to attend.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">We are working diligently to make sure Chancellor White gets a broad overview of what makes HSU special. During his two days here, he will tour the campus, visit some of our off-campus facilities including the Marine Lab and First Street Gallery, and meet with local media. He will have a chance to meet with students, faculty, staff, alumni and community members.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Chancellor White, our seventh Chancellor, has had a distinguished academic career. He previously served as the Chancellor at UC Riverside, and he was also Professor of Biology and of Biomedical Sciences at UC Riverside, where he began his tenure in 2008. Prior to that, he was President of the University of Idaho from 2004 to 2008.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Chancellor White was educated in all three segments of public higher education in California. He attended Diablo Valley Community College, and then earned a bachelor's degree from Fresno State and a master's degree from Cal State Hayward (East Bay). He earned his Ph.D. at UC Berkeley and went on to gain international recognition for his research in muscle plasticity, injury and aging.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">It will be an honor to have Chancellor White on campus, and I am sure he will enjoy his experience learning about Humboldt State.</p>
