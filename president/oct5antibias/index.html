							<p><strong>Dear Campus Community:</strong></p> 
						   

												<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">This message is to update you on the university's ongoing response to the recent hate incident on campus.  First, please know that the University is very concerned with this particular incident, other incidents of bigotry, and any efforts at intimidation. In this case, we are honoring the wishes of the person at whom the specific attack was aimed, first by waiting to release information to the campus community until that person made a decision whether to return to the University, and second by not releasing specifics of the event. We, the Anti-Bias / Anti-Hate Subcommittee of the Diversity Plan Action Council (DPAC), encourage the University community to recognize this incident not only as a violation of an individual but also as a human and social group violation. It is at that level that we can and should respond collectively.</p>

														<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">In that vein, students, staff and faculty held a "stand for human rights" vigil in front of Harry Griffith Hall on October 1 to affirm the importance of human rights and to support diversity on our campus.</p>
														<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">To continue this work of creating a community where all feel welcome, safe, and respected, the Anti-Bias/Anti-Hate Subcommittee has scheduled a "Responding to Hate &ndash; Standing for Justice" forum for Wednesday October 7, 5:00-7:00 p.m., in Goodwin Forum (Nelson Hall East 102).  This Subcommittee is also working to implement a university-wide Rapid Response Team to address hate incidents and to ensure continued dialogue and education in order to improve campus climate.</p>
														<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">To continue these critical dialogues, we encourage your participation in the upcoming 12th Annual Campus Dialogue on Race, November 1-8.  This year's schedule will be available at: <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~dialogue/" title="Campus Dialogue on Race - Welcome" style="color: #546a38; text-decoration: none;">http://www.humboldt.edu/~dialogue/</a></p>
													   
							  <p style="padding: 4px 0px;">							
								Sincerely,   <br/>
                                Anti-Bias/Anti-Hate Subcommittee<br/>
                                Jennifer Eichstedt, Co-Chair</p>
