			<td class="mainbar" align="center" valign="top" style="padding: 22px 0 0 14px; text-align: left;">
				<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Campus Community,</p> 
				
				<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">The state's budget situation continues to change, and next year's funding for the CSU is difficult to predict. Even so, I thought it would be helpful to share with you what we know at this point.</p>
				
				<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Last month, Gov. Jerry Brown released a state budget proposal for 2011-12 that includes a $500 million reduction to the CSU. His proposal seeks to address a budget shortfall estimated at as much as $28 billion over 18 months.  His proposal would reduce state support for the CSU to $2.2 billion, the same level as in 1999, despite the system now enrolling 70,000 more students.</p>
				
				<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">I understand that our state faces a difficult budget situation, and Gov. Brown should be commended for attempting to address it. However, this type of reduction to the CSU system, along with similar reductions in the UC and Community College systems, will have a deep and lasting impact on our state. Higher education is one of the state's main economic engines – California's prosperity is dependent on it.</p> 
				
				<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Perhaps more troubling is that the reduction outlined in the governor's proposal is being described as a “best case” scenario. The governor is seeking to hold a special election to ask voters to extend some current taxes. If the extensions are not approved, the CSU likely faces additional reductions.</p>
				
				<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">At Humboldt, our share of the proposed CSU reduction would likely be around $13 million. This is our best estimate only, based on what we know about the governor's proposal as well as our current portion of CSU funding.</p>
				
				<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Fortunately, we have been very conservative in our spending in recent years. There is $8.5 million in unallocated base funding from the current year, which we did not commit following late approval of the last state budget. In addition, we expect some new base funding because we met this year's enrollment target of 7,010 FTES. There also will be additional revenue from increases in student tuition and fees.</p> 
				
				<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">When we account for the change above, as well as for increases in mandatory costs like health and retirement benefits, we estimate that Humboldt will be facing a net $4.4 million reduction for 2011-12.</p> 
				
				<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">This is likely not a short-term situation. I do not expect that any of this budget reduction will be restored next year. In fact, it probably will not be restored for many years to come, if ever. We cannot depend on one-time approaches.</p>
				
				<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">A reduction of this magnitude will not be simple. It will require creative thinking, collaboration and shared sacrifice. We must make serious changes to the way we operate, and ultimately, despite our best efforts, there is no doubt that this will impact class offerings, student services and enrollment.</p>
				
				<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">In the coming months, I will be working closely with the Provost, Vice Presidents and others to develop a strategy for addressing this reduction. We will consult often with the University Budget Committee, and seek advice and ideas from across campus.</p>
				
				<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">I will strive to keep you updated on the budget situation and campus planning.

				<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Despite this difficult situation, I remain confident about Humboldt's future.</p>
				
				<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">We have worked our way through tough budget and other challenges before. Through them all, we have remained focused on our students and on providing an outstanding education for them. It's a shared commitment that is at the heart of our community, and the reason we should all be proud of the work we do every day.</p>
