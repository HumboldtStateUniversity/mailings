								  <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Campus Community,</p> 

    								<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Over the last few months, I have consulted closely with the Vice Presidents, the University Budget Committee and others about our budget. I have now approved a Budget Plan for the 2011-12 fiscal year.</p>

    																<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">The plan is focused on the same important priorities as during the current year.  Our top priority continues to be student success, both in improving retention and graduation rates as well as advancing the success rate of traditionally underrepresented students, along with academic excellence and educational quality. The second priority is making Humboldt State fiscally stable and growing revenue through enrollment, advancement activities, grants and contracts, and enterprise functions.  The third priority is service to the communities of the North Coast.</p>

    																<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">In February, I sent the University Budget Committee the proposed Budget Plan that had been developed by the Provost, the Vice Presidents and me. We met with the Committee to discuss the proposal and answer questions, and the Committee recently informed me of its endorsement of the overall plan.</p>

    																<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">As we did last year, we have been conservative with our planning. California continues to face intense budget difficulties and its economy continues to struggle. As of now, it is unclear whether the already severe budget reduction now contemplated for the CSU system will become even worse. If the Governor cannot get tax extensions on the ballot, or if voters reject those extensions, our reduction will likely be much worse. </p>

    																<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">This Budget Plan assumes the taxes are extended, and that the CSU is forced to make a budget reduction of $500 million, as the Governor has proposed. By way of perspective, that reduction would bring state support for the CSU system to about $2.2 billion &ndash; the same level as 1999 when it had 70,000 fewer students.</p>

    																<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">In our planning, we estimated that this would represent a reduction of about $13 million for Humboldt State University. After increases in tuition and fees, and because of conservative budgeting last year, we planned for a net base reduction of $4.4 million. Our planning target for enrollment, meanwhile, is 7,010 resident FTES and 217 non-resident FTES. In addition, the campus will make $900,000 in base augmentations, which would make our estimated shortfall $5.3 million. </p>

    																<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">It appears that our actual net reduction in the current proposal, based on new figures recently provided to us by the CSU, would be less than we expected. It would be about $2.5 million rather than $4.4 million, which is at least some positive news. Nevertheless, because of the uncertainty about tax extensions and the possibility that we may be required to make additional large reductions, we are moving ahead with the plan based on our initial estimates.</p>

    																<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">The base budget augmentations for this year are:</p> 
<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;"><strong>Academic Affairs:  $600,000</strong></p> 
<ul style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 30px; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">
	<li>$420,000 for Research and Sponsored Programs to provide funding for pre-award positions and operating expenditures. This is to improve services in SPF and increase revenue for the campus.</li>
		<li>$180,000 for the Offices of Diversity and Inclusion, Institutional Research and Planning, and the Learning Center to base fund a support position and for ongoing expenditures. This is to enhance efforts related to inclusive academic success.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;"><strong>Enrollment Management and Student Affairs: $150,000</strong></p> 
<ul style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 30px; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">
	<li>This is to enhance communications with prospective students and improve overall student recruitment efforts.</li>
</ul>  
<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;"><strong>University Advancement: $150,000</strong></p> 
<ul style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 30px; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;"><li>This is to extend fundraising efforts for the campus.</li></ul>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">To meet the required reduction, we will seek to increase annual revenue within the next three years by $3.1 million. In addition, the three large divisions will make base budget reductions as follows: Academic Affairs $1,530,000, Administrative Affairs $465,000, Enrollment Management and Student Affairs $205,000.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">The President's Office will continue to have an Initiative Fund of $500,000, which should eventually be a base budget allocation. For now, it will remain one-time funds. In the current year, these funds have been used for academic support.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">In its response to the proposal, the University Budget Committee accepted the overall budget plan and gave its strong support to the emphasis on investments related to key priorities and revenue over time. The committee asked that it be reconvened to discuss options if the tax extension is not approved and our budget situation worsens, and I have agreed to do so.</p>
