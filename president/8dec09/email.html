					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Colleagues,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">There are two new reports available online that I would recommend you take the time to review. They provide good perspectives on Humboldt State University's operations and our efforts to make changes. Each will inform our discussions going forward.</p> 
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The two reports are the Educational Effectiveness Review for the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), and the 2009-10 Budget Book. The WASC report is at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/wasc" style="color: #546a38">www.humboldt.edu/wasc</a> and the Budget Book is at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/budget" style="color: #546a38">www.humboldt.edu/budget</a>.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The WASC report includes essays as well as an extensive collection of supporting material. It incorporates many suggestions that were submitted by the campus community this fall, after the initial draft was shared. The report begins to answer a number of essential questions about how we are doing, including:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>What should our students be learning, and how well are they learning it?</li>
						<li>What progress are we making in fostering success for our underrepresented students?</li>
						<li>How can prioritization make a difference in our educational effectiveness?</li>
						<li>How are we integrating curricular oversight?</li>
						<li>How are we planning and implementing institutional change?</li>
					</ul>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The report was prepared by the WASC Steering Committee, chaired by Greg Crawford, and I thank them for all their hard work.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The report was submitted last month in advance of the final visit by our accreditation review team, which will be Feb. 3-5. During that visit, there will be public forums for faculty, staff and students. There will also be a confidential email address available to allow members of the campus community to contact the visiting team members directly.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The Budget Book provides a comprehensive picture of Humboldt State's revenues and expenses from all sources. This is the second year it has been published.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">This report is a valuable tool for building a shared campus-wide understanding of a complex topic. Its annual publication is among a number of steps we are taking to improve our campus budget process, following recommendations made last year by Maddox Management Consulting. The report was prepared by Carol Terry and Lee Lindsey, and I thank them for their efforts.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Again, please take time to review these reports and keep them for reference. The information they contain will serve us well as we go about making choices and decisions about Humboldt State's future.</p>

					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Rollin C. Richmond<br>President</p>
