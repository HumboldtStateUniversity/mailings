					<tr>               
						<td class="mainbar" align="center" valign="top" style="padding: 22px 0 0 14px; text-align: left;">
							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Colleagues,</p> 
							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">As many of you know, Steve Butler, Vice President of Student Affairs, has announced his retirement effective this July.  </p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">In light of Steve's departure, the Provost and I have spoken with many individuals involved with Student Affairs, as well as with professionals outside this University, concerning the future direction of the division. </p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">It is clear that all aspects of Student Affairs must be driven by, or must support, academic priorities and the University vision. The overarching priorities for the new Student Affairs division will be enrollment management, student support and student life. Our plan is not to hire an associate vice president for enrollment management, but to recruit an individual for the vice president's position who has a particular strength in this area. The position will be titled Vice President of Student Affairs and Enrollment Management. </p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">A national search will begin this summer. In the meantime, Buzz Webb has agreed to serve as Interim Vice President of Student Affairs and Enrollment Management starting in July. Buzz served as Vice President for Student Affairs before his retirement, and I appreciate his willingness to help.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Going forward, it is critical that the divisions of Academic Affairs and Student Affairs become more integrated, especially in the areas of enrollment management and student retention. Thus, although the Vice President for Student Affairs and Enrollment Management will report directly to the President, he/she will have a dotted line reporting relationship with the Provost.  That is intended to reinforce the point that close cooperation between the two divisions is important to the University's ability to serve our students.  </p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Retention programs that have primarily an academic component will be concentrated and coordinated under Academic Affairs. The Health Center and Counseling, as well as Housing, will remain in Student Affairs. University Center, University Police and Athletics will be moved to other divisions so that the new vice president can concentrate on the above-mentioned priorities. Associated Students will continue to have a dotted line reporting relationship directly to the Vice President.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">It is clear that the landscape of higher education is changing rapidly. In response, universities have had to reshape how they are organized and what they offer students. This shift is perhaps even more critical and immediate for institutions, such as Humboldt, that have depended heavily on what is now shrinking state support. Growing competition for eligible students highlights the need for Humboldt State to focus on recruiting a qualified and diverse student body, devising a means to retain students through graduation and providing the best possible education. Doing all of this in an environment where resources are scarce is indeed a challenge. </p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">I want to thank everyone who is assisting with this transition. Changes such as those now underway are never easy, but I believe we have a group of people who will make it successful. Our dedicated student affairs and academic professionals are deeply committed to our students, and HSU is fortunate to have them.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Finally, please join me in thanking Steve Butler for his commitment to our students and for his good service to Humboldt State University. We wish him well in this new chapter of his life.</p>

								Sincerely, <br /> <br />
								Rollin C. Richmond<br/>
