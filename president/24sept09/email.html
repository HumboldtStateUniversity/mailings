					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Dear HSU Community Member:</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Recently there was an incident on campus of racial hatred that involved a written attack against a faculty member. This is a hateful and cowardly act. The faculty member involved has resigned from the university in fear for his/her safety. The outrage and sorrow expressed by those members of the campus community who know of this incident reiterate the university's absolute and unequivocal refusal to tolerate this kind of behavior. The University Police Department has been notified and is investigating the incident.  Let us all continue to reflect on the challenges of social justice and inclusivity that continue to elude us &#8212; as a campus community and as a society overall. It is essential that we strive to find ways to make our campus a safer and more humane community. Everyone will benefit from the opportunity to experience and learn from a diverse faculty and staff.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Let us reaffirm our support for HSU's vision and use it to guide our interactions with members of the campus community: <em>We will be renowned for social and environmental responsibility and action.</em></p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,<br>Rollin C. Richmond<br>President</p>
