						<td class="mainbar" align="center" valign="top" style="padding: 22px 0 0 14px; text-align: left;">
							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Colleagues,</p> 
							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">It is hard to believe that final exams are underway and Commencement ceremonies are just a few days from now. Another academic year is coming to a close at Humboldt State University.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">I hope you feel the same pride I do as our students turn in their last papers, or move out of the residence halls, or walk across the stage as new graduates. You have all been part of their success. You have helped them gain a better understanding of the world and themselves.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">So pat yourself on the back &ndash; you have spent another year changing the world. I thank you for your efforts, and I know from my conversations with students that they are especially grateful.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">This was an important year for HSU. Yes, there were many challenges including the budget, but I think we will look back on this year primarily as one with a significant positive impact on our institution's future. It was a year in which we were able to come together, honestly evaluate ourselves and make tough decisions.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">This year, to give just a few examples, saw the completion of our WASC accreditation review, academic program prioritization, and the program elimination process. We took action related to outside reviews of our organizational structure and culture, and our budget process. Our Cabinet for Institutional Change completed its study of many of our biggest challenges, and we began implementing its recommendations. Hundreds of people across campus were involved in these efforts, in addition to their regular work.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">We have made progress as an organization. We now have a much better understanding of our institutional strengths and opportunities. We have discovered new approaches to campus governance and a renewed emphasis on pursuing clear priorities.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">This work didn't take place in the classroom, but it was, in fact, all about our students. When we operate more effectively, efficiently and collaboratively, our students are the ones who benefit. It helps ensure that we can continue offering a great educational experience &ndash; one with close student-faculty interaction, hands-on learning, and an emphasis on social and environmental responsibility.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">We see the results of that approach in the extraordinary achievements of our students. This year, students have won a top EPA award for a smart-grid in Bhutan, helped bring in a $4.4 million energy grant for our region and convinced Zale Co. to adopt eco-friendly gold purchasing policies. They published a slew of academic papers and made presentations at academic conferences, organized major events like the California Big Time and Social Gathering, and earned honors at academic competitions. The list goes on, and everyone at Humboldt played a part.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">So once again, thank you for all that you do, day after day, at HSU. I hope you have an enjoyable summer, and that you are able to spend some relaxing time with family and friends. You certainly deserve it.</p>

								Sincerely, <br /> <br />
								Rollin C. Richmond<br/> 
								President
