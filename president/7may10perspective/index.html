							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Colleagues,</p> 
							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Many of you recently received a letter from the faculty union about a report it commissioned on HSU finances. The report was written by a Professor Howard Bunsis of Eastern Michigan University.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">From the feedback we have received, we are concerned that the report's misleading conclusions have created confusion and misunderstanding. And unfortunately, it comes at the end of a year in which the campus community has made real progress in working together to address big challenges. Because of that, we would like to provide some context.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">The most important point is that Professor Bunsis apparently misunderstood the many laws and policies guiding how HSU spends money. In arguing that HSU enjoyed a "solid financial position" with a multi-million dollar reserve, he seems to believe that all funds can be used for any purposes - that HSU can pay for daily operations using things like parking fees, student housing payments, construction bond monies, and other designated funds. None of this is allowed. We do not operate like a for-profit business, and there is no massive "reserve" that HSU can spend as we please. We are disappointed Professor Bunsis did not take the time to contact our campus budget staff to gain a better understanding of this.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Further, it is clear that public universities in California are struggling financially. To suggest that Humboldt State University does not have a budget problem is irresponsible. The union itself has been one of the groups lobbying hard for more higher education funding, which makes its endorsement of Professor Bunsis' rosy outlook somewhat mystifying.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">We have worked very hard to open up HSU's budget process. Many more people are now involved, and much more information is being provided (see the <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/budget" style="color: #476a31; text-decoration: none;">Budget Office website</a>).</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">In contrast with that positive work, we believe the union's letter simply creates discord and controversy, and we understand some union administrators feel that sort of thing is helpful. At the state level, in particular, this is seen as an acceptable tactic related to collective bargaining. However, we are very disappointed in the timing and the fact that some HSU faculty leaders chose to sign this letter when we and the Academic Senate have committed to working together more cooperatively. Their actions undermine our efforts to move toward a more collegial, collaborative and respectful structure for university governance.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">The end of the semester should be a time of celebrating the many successes of our students and of wishing our soon-to-be graduates the best. It is not a time to launch a divisive debate about a complex and questionable report on campus finances.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Humboldt State University has come a long way this year in terms of working more collaboratively and strategically on behalf of our students. Much has been accomplished, and we know we can do even more to make HSU a stronger institution by continuing these efforts in years to come. We very much appreciate the efforts of so many people who have been involved.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Thank you for your attention.</p>
