								<p  style="padding: 4px 0px;">Dear Campus Community,</p>

								<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">In late January, the campus Cabinet for Institutional Change submitted a thorough report that outlines how HSU can begin addressing many of our difficult challenges. That report has now been reviewed by campus governance groups, and we have begun working to implement the recommendations. I expect that work to continue through the end of next spring semester.</p>

													<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">A copy of the report, and background material about the Cabinet, are available at <a href="http://change.humboldt.edu" title="Cabinet for Institutional Change - Humboldt State University" style="color: #546a38;">http://change.humboldt.edu</a>.</p>

													<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">I want to thank all of the groups that reviewed the report for their diligent and timely responses. The Associated Students and Staff Council enthusiastically endorsed the recommendations. The Academic Senate also endorsed the recommendations, including the proposal to create a University-wide Senate and restructure our committee system, but recommended a faculty vote on eliminating the General Faculty Association.</p>

													<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">I will work with these groups to create a steering committee to follow the progress in implementing the Cabinet's recommendations. The steering committee will provide regular reports to the campus.</p>

													<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We owe the members of the Cabinet a great deal of appreciation for their hard work in leading a broad, year-long conversation with the campus community. It resulted in an action plan for making us a stronger institution that is better able to serve our students and the community.</p>



								<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,<br/> <br/>

								Rollin C. Richmond  <br/>
								President</p>
