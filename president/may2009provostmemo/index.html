					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Dear Students and Colleagues:</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">These are unusual times for Humboldt State University and for the California State University system.  Our state is facing record budget deficits, and we do not yet have a final state budget. In recognition of the difficulties we face and the advice provided by many members of the University community as well as the WASC (Western Association of Schools and Colleges) consultants, I will name Dr. Robert Snyder, Professor of Philosophy, as our permanent Provost effective July 1, 2009.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We have been fortunate to have a long-time member of our faculty, Professor Robert Snyder, serving as our Interim Provost.  However, in light of the challenges we are facing, the momentum Bob is building as well as the ongoing and upcoming Dean searches, Humboldt State will greatly benefit from having a permanent Provost in place.  Dr. Snyder also has significant experience as a member of local and statewide shared-governance groups, and he has served both as a departmental chairperson and as the dean of the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences.  As someone who spent seven years as a Provost at two universities, I believe that Provost Snyder is doing an excellent job leading the academic units of our campus and serving as the first-among-equals of our vice presidents.  Bob makes hard decisions after consideration of all perspectives, and he clearly has the best interests of the faculty, students, staff and community in mind.  The process to prioritize academic programs that Bob initiated has resulted in an excellent assessment of our programs and will provide a good basis for the many difficult decisions we will face in the future.  Indeed, the faculty in several programs have already begun to consider changes in their departments based on the judgments of their colleagues who served on the prioritization group.  Bob is also working with the Cabinet for Institutional Change that was advocated by one of our recent accreditation consultants.  This group is making significant progress on difficult issues in order to change our campus culture as was recommended by the initial WASC review.  Bob is successfully addressing the budget challenges facing academic affairs.  In the timeframe of less than two years, Bob has made significant progress for this university.  HSU would indeed have been fortunate to have identified someone with similar leadership skills in a national search process.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Both of the consultant groups brought to campus following our initial WASC review recommended that Bob Snyder be appointed the permanent Provost.  Moreover, searches for several deans positions are in process or will soon be underway, and the best candidates for these positions will be more likely to accept an appointment if we have a permanent Provost in place.  Indeed, one candidate for a dean position has indicated that an offer would not be accepted in the absence of a permanent provost. Bob is the right person, with the right perspective and background at the right time in the history of HSU to help lead us through the difficulties we face.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">I fully understand that the faculty, students and staff expect to play a role in the selection of senior administrative leaders for our university.  I do not intend that this decision will set a precedent for any future action during my presidency.  I also understand that we spoke earlier of the need to have a national search, but these conversations took place before the full implications of the state's financial condition were apparent.  I do understand that some colleagues will not agree with this decision, and that I sincerely regret.  However, many other faculty and staff to whom I have spoken are very supportive of this decision. We are fortunate to have found among our existing faculty an effective leader of high integrity to serve as our permanent provost.  Please join me in supporting Provost Snyder as he works with us to effect the changes that will ensure the future of Humboldt State University.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Rollin C. Richmond<br>President</p>
