					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Dear Campus Community,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We invite you to <strong>join us on Friday, Feb. 13</strong> for a discussion of the state's budget crisis and the challenge it poses for the California State University system. The event, presented by the Alliance for the CSU, will be from noon to 1 p.m. in the Kate Buchanan Room.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Among our guests will be our State Senator Pat Wiggins and our Assemblymember Wesley Chesbro.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Speakers will explain what you can do to help protect the budget of the CSU and Humboldt State University. In addition, volunteers will be on hand to gather letters and faxes to be sent to Sacramento.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The Alliance for the CSU is a coalition of students, faculty, staff, administrators, alumni and community supporters. It was formed last year as the Legislature was considering a $313 million budget cut to the CSU, and played a large part in reducing that cut to $215 million.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We need the Alliance to keep pressing the case. With California facing a growing deficit estimated at $42 billion, the CSU and Humboldt State face even more cuts. If this continues, we risk losing the quality, affordable higher education that California has enjoyed for generations.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">There's no question that cutting the CSU is bad policy. With the state's economy struggling, we need the Legislature and the Governor to understand that the "CSU is the Solution."</p>

					<ul>
						<li>The CSU generates $4.41 in economic activity for every dollar that is invested.</li>
						<li>The CSU graduates 90,000 students each year, making us vital to a knowledge-based economy.</li>
						<li>Cuts to the CSU especially reduce college access for our veterans, ethnic minorities and first-generation college students.</li>
					</ul>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">In addition to the $215 million initial cut for this year, the Governor is proposing cutting $66 million more from our current budget. That's on top of $31 million in mid-year cuts from November. For 2009-10, the Governor proposes to make the $66 million cut permanent and is assuming the CSU will increase student fees by another 10 percent.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The CSU has already been forced to reduce planned enrollment by 10,000 students this year. Graduation for thousands of other students has been delayed, and important student services like academic advising are being cut. </p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">At Humboldt State, these cuts are coming even as enrollment is growing. We estimate that our best-case scenario at this point is a $1 million budget cut next year. And our academic program budget, which is being supported this year with one-time funding, will have to cut its budget next year by about $2 million.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">As a campus community, we need to let our leaders in Sacramento know this isn't acceptable.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Feel free to contact any of us with ideas. In addition, we suggest two websites that have more information and ideas: the <a href="http://allianceforthecsu.org" style="color: #546a38;">Alliance for the CSU</a> and the <a href="http://humboldt.kintera.org" style="color: #546a38;">Humboldt State Advocacy Center</a>.</p>
 
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Please join us on Friday, and make sure that Sacramento gets the message. Higher education is an investment that benefits everyone Ð and cuts to higher education are ultimately harmful to everyone. </p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Thank you,</p>
