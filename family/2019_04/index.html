                                                    <h3>What you need to know about Study Abroad</h3>
                                                    <p>Studying abroad can be one of the most exciting and illuminating experiences in a college student’s career. Humboldt State offers a number of opportunities for your student to attend school in another country and expand their understanding of the world.   </p>

                                                    <p>Study Abroad Coordinator Emily Kirsch encourages students in all majors to experience going to school in a different country. Here is some of her advice for students and their families interested in studying abroad. </p>
                                                    
                                                    <p><strong>What are some of the most popular destinations?</strong><br>
                                                    <em>Students tend to be most interested in English-speaking destinations - Australia and the United Kingdom - because they can take classes in English in educational systems that are similar to ours here in the U.S. That being said, there are cultural differences that students need to adjust to.</em></p>
                                                    
                                                    <p><em>We've also seen a lot of interest in Spain this year, as Matthew Dean, World Languages & Cultures Chair, will be there next year. Our faculty-led summer programs, which HSU faculty lead in the summer semester, tend to be quite popular as well due to the relationships students build with their faculty members. These programs change summer to summer depending on what the faculty are offering.This year, we have two programs going to Oaxaca, Mexico and to Costa Rica.</em></p>
                                                    
                                                    <p><strong>Which majors study abroad?</strong><br>
                                                    <em>Studying abroad is a requirement for International Studies majors, so we definitely see a lot of students there. Students in Anthropology, Environmental Science Management, Environmental Studies, Wildlife, and World Languages and Cultures majors (French, Spanish) tend to go abroad as well. But there are opportunities for students in every major at HSU.</em></p> 
                                                    
                                                    <p><strong>Is Study Abroad affordable? What kind of financial support is there?</strong><br>
                                                    <em>If a student receives California state-based aid, and federal financial aid, their best bets are our Bilateral Exchange programs (semester-long) and CSU International Programs (year-long). </em></p>
                                                    
                                                    <p><em>These programs are essentially the same cost as attending HSU--the only difference is the cost of living, flight, visa, and health insurance. All financial aid a student receives can be applied to these programs. Sometimes the cost of living is cheaper overseas, depending on location, especially if they live in on-campus housing. </em></p>
                                                    
                                                    <p><em>There are also many summer programs that are shorter in duration and more cost-effective, as well as our HSU faculty-led programs. Depending on the student's specific financial aid situation, some aid might even be available during the summer.  Scholarships are available as well, and I recommend students treat applying to scholarships like applying for a job--they're out there, but you have to work for them!</em></p>
                                                    
                                                    <p><strong>Why study abroad?</strong><br>
                                                    <em>For me personally, studying abroad was the most impactful part of my college education. I'm an HSU alumna and studied abroad in Xi'an, China. It obviously had a big effect on my life and career. </em></p>
                                                    
                                                    <p><em>It's an opportunity for students to challenge themselves, to live and learn in a new context, and reflect on their identity. The experience also enables them to have a broader understanding of the world around them.</em></p>
