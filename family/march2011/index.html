<p>Hello Humboldt families! We hope this newsletter helps keep you involved with your student's experience at Humboldt State.</p>

<h1 style="font:24px helvetica, arial, san-serif;margin:32px 0 0 0;">Parents &amp; Family Fund Builds Foundation for Student Success</h1>
<p style="margin:0;">Desiree Perez</p>

<p>It's part of being a parent or family member of a college student: you're always looking for ways to help. And, whether it's sending a <a style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.humboldt.edu/housing/dining/locations/carepacks.html">care package</a> when your student gets sick or coming up for a visit during <a style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;" href="http://humboldt.edu/homecoming/">Homecoming &amp; Family Weekend</a>, you always seem to find a way.</p>

<p>Thanks to the generosity of parents and families, what was once HSU's biological sciences stock room has grown to become the university's Biology Core Laboratory Facilities. Although you may not have stacked the bricks for this fully-functioning facility that is outfitted with cutting-edge equipment, you certainly laid the foundation. In fact, parents and families contributed more than $380,000 to HSU just last year.</p>

<p>Your donations to the Parents &amp; Family Fund have helped ensure that undergraduate and graduate students from a variety of disciplines have hands-on access to the some of the most innovative DNA research and analysis techniques.</p>


<p>"This is really a college-wide lab, more than just a biology lab. I really want to get wildlife students, chemistry students, environmental studies students in here and make this space available to anyone, really, who has the training to use this stuff," says Anthony Baker, manager of the core facilities.</p>

<p>"This facility is a resource. We want people to come in and ask questions. It's great for students; it puts them on the spot and makes them think. Plus it's great training for the real world environment," he says.</p>

<p>So far, students from a number of different majors have used the lab to study global issues like West Nile virus to local issues concerning the North Coast's fisheries. And this is just one example of how donations to the Parents &amp; Family Fund support students.</p>

<p>This year, in conjunction with the Humboldt Loyalty Fund, the Parents &amp; Family Fund is providing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assistance in sending students and faculty to make presentations at academic conferences throughout the country, in the amount of $100,000<br/>
Because of these contributions, students from our <a style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;" href="http://now.humboldt.edu/news/hsu-wins-75g-in-epa-sustainability-innovation/">Renewable Energy Student Union were able to attend the National Sustainable Design Expo., where they were awarded a $75,000 EPA sustainability award</a>.
</li>
<li>Dean's Project Funds for special initiatives, equipment and other needs in the colleges and library, in the amount of $75,000</li>
<li>New tanks and technically sophisticated equipment at the Telonicher Marine Lab in Trinidad, Calif., in the amount of $10,000</li>
<li>Assistance in bringing prominent academic speakers to campus, in the amount of $10,000</li>
</ul>

<p>"These services and programs are essential to enriching the Humboldt experience for our students," says Randi Darnall Burke, Dean of Students. "We are very grateful to parents and family members for their decision to support the university. They are making a real difference in the educational experience of students here."</p>

<p>Humboldt State alum Alexandra Goodell runs her very own carnival and she has appeared on the History Channel--but she is not a circus barker.</p>

<p>Alex is the self-made impresario of the "The Copepod Carnival," a light show starring itty-bitty shrimp named copepods ("koepuh-pods"). <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/meet/ourgrads/bio/goodell.php" title="Alexandra Goodell - Our Grads - Meet Humboldt" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">Read More &raquo;</a></p>

<h3 style="font:18px helvetica, arial, san-serif;margin-top:32px;">Overheard this month on the family network</h3>																															<p>"Just a friendly message to parents of first year students....if you think you will be traveling to Arcata to help your kiddies move out of the dorms in May, beware that most hotels start filling up by February, require a two night minimum and nearly double the price of the rooms. The kids have to be out of their dorms the day of graduation, so it gets a little hectic on campus and in town." <a href="http://www.hsufamilynetwork.org/" title="Sign In to HSU Family Network - HSU Family Network" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">Read more &raquo;</a></p>

<p>HSU thanks the proud families who supported students last year through the Parents &amp; Family Fund. One such parent who supports the campus is Glenda Hay. "My son is being directly shaped by his experience at HSU. I feel I should do what I can to help HSU in this important task," she said.</p>
