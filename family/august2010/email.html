												<p>Hello Humboldt families! We hope this newsletter helps keep you involved with your student's experience at Humboldt State.</p>

												<h1 style="font:24px helvetica, arial, san-serif;margin:32px 0 0 0;">Moving in Without a Hitch</h1>
												<p style="margin:0;">Desiree Perez</p>

		<p>In just a couple of weeks, the residence halls will open and nearly 2,000 students will move in to their Humboldt homes-away-from-home.</p>

		<p>If you're helping your student move, here are some tips from the Housing Office and other parents who've lived through the rush:</p>

		<p><strong>From the Housing Office</strong></p>

		<p>First, know the check-in hours for the day your student plans to move in. Check-in takes place at the Jolly Giant Commons and is required before students can access their new rooms. Here's the schedule:</p>

		<p><strong>Tues &ndash; Sun, Aug. 17-22:</strong><br>9 a.m. &ndash; 10 p.m. 1st Floor, Recreation Room</p>

		<p><strong>Mon, Aug. 23</strong><br/>9 a.m. &ndash; 4 p.m. 2nd Floor, Housing Office<br/>5 p.m. &ndash; 10 p.m. 1st Floor, Recreation Room</p>

		<p>There are 20-minute parking spots near the residence halls. After unloading your student's boxes, move your car to the parking lot to avoid dreaded parking tickets.</p>

		<p>If you don't want to drive with a car full of boxes, ship them ahead of time. Once you arrive, students can pick up packages at the mailroom in the Jolly Giant Commons. Make sure to send packages to your student's specific residence hall address &ndash; otherwise delivery will be delayed.</p>

		<p>Students living off-campus might not want to use all the fixtures or furnishings that came with their new place. Remove and store things like blinds and curtains to ensure they're in good condition when it's time to move out &ndash; and time to get the security deposit back.</p>

		<p>Don't forget to stop occasionally, take a break and eat. Depending on when you arrive, dining on campus may not be open, but there are many options in town to help keep you fueled up.</p>

		<p><strong>From Parents</strong></p>

		<p>Enterprising parents can sometimes find helpful students willing to lend a hand, so "you don't lug all those boxes up" by yourself. Many parents find that snacks, sodas and cold water are greatly appreciated as a thank-you. If no one's around to help, Housing provides handcarts to make the move easier.</p>

		<p>A big tip: Put your student's name and room number on all boxes. One family learned this lesson the hard way: "We didn't and we had a very important box that took about four days to find!"</p>

		<p>When moving in off-campus, "take dated photos or video and note any existing damages or cleaning that hasn't been done," and make sure the landlord gets it. Keeping track of these things will help your student avoid unnecessary damage charges when moving out.</p>

		<p>Finally, while you and your student are arranging the room, "keep a notepad handy for a shopping list." Once you start unpacking, you'll get a good idea of additional supplies you might need to buy before heading back home.</p>

				<p>"The Costa Rica Primate Field Program I participated in through HSU Extended Education was definitely my favorite experience. I learned so much about primates during this program, but even more about myself and how much I was capable of. Plus, who gets to say that they spent their 20th birthday in a tropical rain forest in Costa Rica surrounded by a bunch of primates?" <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/meet/ourstudents/bio/hitzeman.php" title="Katie Hitzeman - Our Students - Meet Humboldt" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">Read More &raquo;</a></p>

We also got her a credit card and debit/ATM. The credit card is so she could establish credit. She always lets us know if she needs to use it, which isn't often. The ATM is so she can take out a weekly allowance. The kids do find ways to spend $ off-campus on the weekends: movies, concerts, eating out, etc. Next summer, the emphasis will be on getting a job!" <a href="http://www.hsufamilynetwork.org/" title="Sign In to HSU Family Network - HSU Family Network" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">Read more &raquo;</a></p>
