			<p>Hello Humboldt families! We hope this newsletter helps keep you involved with your student's experience at Humboldt State.</p>

			<h1 style="font:24px helvetica, arial, san-serif;margin:32px 0 0 0;">Getting Ahead After Graduation</h1>
			<p style="margin:0;">Desiree Perez</p>

			<p>Graduation is days away and, if your student is completing his or her HSU career, it's time to take on the next adventure: a professional career. Fortunately, the <a style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;" href="http://alumni.humboldt.edu/s/857/index.aspx?sid=857&gid=1&pgid=475">HSU Alumni Association's Career Network</a> offers some of the leading online career services available to help your grad kick-start the job of his or her dreams.</p>

			<p>Even if your student has a few semesters left, he or she can get started on post-graduation plans now by visiting the <a style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;" href="http://humboldt.edu/career/">Career Center</a>.</p>

			<p>I spoke with Dean Hart, Director of Alumni Relations about the Alumni Association's career services. "Our research has shown that, during these challenging economic times, whether you're an impending graduate looking for your first job or an alumnus/a experiencing a transition step, these tools can help you with the whole process," he says.</p>
			
			<p>Here are a few highlights he mentioned to give your soon-to-be-grad a competitive edge.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Career Beam<br /><br />
				Career Beam is a free service to members of the Humboldt Alumni Community. It offers a number of online exercises and assessments to help your grad on the career path. It's a valuable service to our alumni, where they can take personal assessments, refine their resumes and cover letters and pick up tips and tricks for the job search.</li><br />
				<li>Interview Stream
	<br /><br />
				If your grad gets nervous about the interview process, this is a useful tool to help her or him conquer the jitters and give a shining first impression to perspective employers.
	<br /><br />
				Using a webcam, a video interviewer from the selected field will "interview" your grad using questions asked in real job interviews. The interview will be recorded and played back to help your grad assess his or her performance. 
	<br /><br />
				Current students can also make an appointment for a <a style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;" href="http://humboldt.edu/career/resources/interview_tips">mock interview</a> with his or her Career Counselor for tips on everything from avoiding "um"s to choosing attire.</li><br />
				<li>Alumni Networking
	<br /><br />
				The Alumni Association is working to create networking opportunities for alumni to connect to each other and current students. One example is our Speed Networking night, which took place on Apr. 26. At Speed Networking, current students connect to alumni in a series of fun, fast-paced, face-to-face networking sessions. It's a great way to learn about recruitment opportunities, exchange business cards and explore areas of interest for life after graduation.
			</li><br />
				<li>Career Center
	<br /><br />
				The HSU Career Center offers free services and support to help your student find a part-time job or a career. Even though your student is graduating, he or she can still take advantage of those services. <a style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;" href="http://humboldt.edu/career/alumni/">Alumni</a> can get free support with resumes, links to career sites, even workshops and on-campus interview practice.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Your student's time at Humboldt was great preparation for a career. During that time he or she learned quite a bit about themself and the world, and got to learn both in and out of the classroom, gaining experience while tackling real-world problems. Your student put in a lot of hard work to get to graduation; when it comes putting that education to work, the Humboldt Alumni Office can help.</p>

			<h3 style="font:18px helvetica, arial, san-serif;margin-top:32px;">Humboldt State is Turning 100</h3>																															<p>In 2013, we'll celebrate HSU's centennial. We're excited to mark this momentous occasion and need help planning all the fun.

In hindsight, I wish we'd got a friend to share the space."

			<p>HSU thanks the proud families who supported students last year through the Parents &amp; Family Fund. One such family that supports the campus is Richard Lambie and his wife Sandy, whose daughter, Sarah, recently became an HSU alumna. "Sarah graduated last year with a Psychology degree, and I am proud to say she was offered a full-time teaching job, winning out over candidates with master's degrees," Richard says. "When I hear about successes like these, I am more committed than ever to insuring that future students receive a high-quality Humboldt education. That is why Sandy and I support the Humboldt Parents &amp; Family Fund."</p>
