												<p>Hello Humboldt families! We hope this newsletter helps keep you involved with your student's experience at Humboldt State.</p>

												<h1 style="font:24px helvetica, arial, san-serif;margin:32px 0 0 0;">Mark Your Calendar &ndash;<br>Homecoming &amp; Family Weekend</h1>
												<p style="margin:0;">Desiree Perez</p>

		<p>It's still summer, but planning is well underway for Homecoming &amp; Family Weekend, Oct. 15 &ndash; 17. You'll still be able to enjoy football, the big BBQ, and time with your student &ndash; but this year there will also be an Arts Showcase, Behind-the-Scenes Tours and much more. If you've ever thought about attending, this is the year to do it. And if you've been before, you should definitely come again to check out the new and expanded version.</p>

		<p>You'll want to get into town well before 4 p.m. on Friday so you can meet other families at the Parent &amp; Family reception. And don't miss Sunday brunch at the "J" for good food and goodbyes.</p>

		<p>Here's a preview &hellip;</p>

		<p><strong>Friday, Oct. 15</strong></p>

		<p><strong>4 p.m.</strong><br>Parent &amp; Family Welcome Reception: Mingle with other families while enjoying hors d'oeuvres that showcase the flavors of Humboldt County.</p>

		<p><strong>8 p.m.</strong><br/>Attend a screening of National Geographic's "Redwood Giants," a documentary featuring HSU professor Steven Sillett.</p>

		<p><strong>Saturday, Oct. 16</strong></p>

		<p><strong>10 a.m.</strong><br/>Class Without Quizzes: Lively lectures &ndash; but no homework or tests.</p>

		<p><strong>4 p.m.</strong><br/>Pre-game Party: Enjoy the BBQ with your student and the extended HSU community.</p>

		<p><strong>6 p.m.</strong><br/>The Game: At HSU, the Homecoming game is a community event. Root for the Jacks, see the Marching Lumberjacks and catch some school spirit.</p>

		<p>If football just isn't your game, there are plenty of other evening events. Check out a volleyball game, catch a theatrical production or attend a performance by HSU's Symphonic Orchestra.</p>

		<p><strong>Sunday, Oct. 17</strong></p>

		<p><strong>10 a.m.</strong><br/>Wrap it up with Brunch at the "J":</p>

		<p>There is much more being planned, so check out the Homecoming &amp; Family Weekend website for the most updated information: <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/homecoming" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">www.humboldt.edu/homecoming</a>.</p>

				<p>"I chose HSU because the journalism department had more than just a newspaper. Osprey Magazine and KRFH sounded like fun and offered a bigger range of experience than other schools had. After graduation I plan to move to San Francisco and apply for jobs in advertising or layout. I have considered grad school but have not made any decisions yet. If I do go, it will be to an arts school for Graphic Design." <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/meet/ourstudents/bio/dupre.php" title="Meagan Dupre - Our Students - Meet Humboldt" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">Read More &raquo;</a></p>

I was impressed last year when we dropped off my freshman how well stocked the whole store was. Also microwaves are allowed. You will want to get a small one that will fit on top of the frig because there isn't a lot of space in the dorm rooms."    																								<a href="http://www.hsufamilynetwork.org/" title="Sign In to HSU Family Network - HSU Family Network" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">Read more &raquo;</a></p>
