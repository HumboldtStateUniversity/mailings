					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Dear Humboldt Parent,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">I'm writing to request your assistance with a new website that we are creating for parents and families with students at Humboldt State University.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The site is designed to help you and other Humboldt families talk to and learn from each other. You can post a question, start a discussion, and share your experiences with others. It will feature short profiles of each participant, and you can share as much or as little information about yourself as you'd like.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Before the site gets up and running, we'd like to have a few profiles ready to go so we're asking those who already subscribe to the Humboldt parent listserv to be the first to participate.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">To get started, just <a href="http://www.hsufamilynetwork.org/" style="color: #006885;">visit HSUfamilynetwork.org and register for the site</a>. All you need to do is answer a few questions, attach a picture (if desired), and then start posting.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Thanks for your assistance. We hope that this website helps Humboldt parents and families learn from the true experts&#8212;each other.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,<br><br>Randi Darnall Burke<br>Dean of Students</p>
