												<h1 style="font:24px helvetica, arial, san-serif;margin:32px 0 0 0;">Staying Safe on Campus</h1>
												<p style="margin:0;">Desiree Perez</p>

		<p>Now that the semester is in full swing, your student has probably made some friends, settled into a routine with classes and is ready to let loose after midterm meltdowns &ndash; just in time for Halloween.</p>

		<p>It might sound like a risky combination &ndash; but you can relax, too. I spoke with Lieutenant Lynne Soderberg and Emergency Management Coordinator Jan Marnell of the University Police Department about staying safe on campus. Here are some of their tips for parents to share with students, to put you both at ease.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Talk with your student about alcohol use. Responsible drinking is crucial for safety and can reduce the risk of dangers, including falls, car accidents and sexual assaults.  Underage drinking is not allowed on campus or in the community.</li>
		
			<li>Be aware of your surroundings. Know your routes and the possible hazards of each.</li>

			<li>Be aware of the more than 60 "blue light phones" located across campus. These free, emergency call boxes are well-lit and connect callers to HSU's 911 Emergency Dispatch Center, staffed 24/7. Students can also reach UPD by calling 707-826-5555 or 5555 from any campus phone.</li>

			<li>In case of an earthquake: Drop, Cover and Hold On until the shaking stops. If you are on the beach or in a low-lying area (i.e., Bayshore Mall or Old Town Eureka), and you feel an earthquake last longer than 30 seconds, abandon what you're doing and get to higher ground. (The HSU campus is well above any tsunami hazard zone).</li>

			<li>Use the Police Escort System if you ever feel unsafe traveling on campus. UPD will escort students safely between any points on campus, whether on foot, in a cruiser or on bikes together.</li>

			<li>Carry a flashlight. Even during the day, a power outage could make it harder to get to safety. At home, keep a flashlight and a pair of sturdy walking shoes in a small bag that's easy to locate.</li>

			<li>Know the evacuation routes and rally points on campus. Evacuation Plans are posted in each classroom, lab and near the interior exits of each building.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>HSU has also taken steps to ensure campus-wide safety in case of an emergency. Recently, a new $200,000 audible alert, voice-warning and strobe light system was installed, designed to be effective from every point on campus.</p>

		<p>On Oct. 21, HSU will be one of many organizations participating in the Great California Shakeout earthquake preparedness drill. <a href="http://www.shakeout.org/" title="ShakeOut - Get Ready!" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">Register to participate</a>.</p>

		<p>In case of an emergency, UPD encourages families to:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Visit the <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/" title="Humboldt State University" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">HSU homepage</a> and <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/emergency" title="Emergency Conditions &bull; Humboldt State University" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">emergency website</a> for emergency conditions.</li> 

			<li><a href="http://www.khsu.org/" title="KHSU-FM 90.5 Arcata,CA" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">Tune in to KHSU at 90.5 FM</a>.</li>
			
			<li><a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/emergency/subscribe/" title="Subscribe to Emergency Conditions &bull; Humboldt State University" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">Sign up for RSS feeds</a> that go directly to your computer or email.</li> 

			<li>For emergency information, call 707-826-INFO (4636). Please do not call UPD for information in the event of an emergency.</li>
		</ul>
		
		

		<p>Students should sign up to receive emergency text message alerts. See <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/emergency/faqs#how" title="FAQs About Emergency Text Messaging &bull; Humboldt State University" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">instructions for subscribing</a>.</p>

				<p>"Advice for new students: Don't take any of these classes your first semester: Chem 109, Bio 105, Bot 105, Math 105. They are all intensively, high work level classes, and you don't want to overwhelm yourself while you are still adjusting to living on your own in a new place. Also, don't be afraid to go talk to your professors. If you are having a hard time, or if you get sick, or if anything happens, go talk to them. They are people. They are teachers. They sympathize and want you to do the best you can, and almost every one of them will do everything they can to help you out." <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/meet/ourstudents/bio/neal.php" title="Tawny Neal - Our Students - Meet Humboldt" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">Read More &raquo;</a></p>

														<p>HSU thanks the many families who supported students last year through the Parents &amp; Family Fund. One such parent who supports the campus is Glenda Hay. "My son is being directly shaped by his experience at HSU. I feel I should do what I can to help HSU in this important task," she says.</p>
