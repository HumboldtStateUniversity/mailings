		<p>Hello Humboldt families! We hope this newsletter helps keep you involved with your student's experience at Humboldt State.</p>

		<h1 style="font:24px helvetica, arial, san-serif;margin:32px 0 0 0;">Counting Down to Commencement</h1>
		<p style="margin:0;">Desiree Perez</p>

		<p>The end of the academic year can be a hectic time for anyone&mdash;add in the festivities of Commencement, and things can get down right stressful. But it is a wonderful way to celebrate the end of your student's educational journey and look forward to a new phase of his or her life&mdash;and yours too!</p>

		<p>I spoke to Mary Kay Hartmann, Commencement Coordinator here at HSU, to get a few tips and highlights about this year's ceremony to help you streamline and de-stress your experience. We want you to focus on your grad and leave the worrying to us.</p>

		<p><strong>Beat the Traffic</strong></p>


		<p>It's really frustrating to be running late for an important event like graduation. Arriving early can help ease the stress of this busy day.</p>

		<p>Your student should plan to arrive a half-hour early, which means by the following times:</p>

		<p><strong>8 a.m.</strong> College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences<br />
		<strong>11:30 a.m.</strong> College of Natural Resources and Sciences<br />
		<strong>3 p.m.</strong> College of Professional Studies</p>


		<p>If you arrive at about the same time, you'll have plenty of time to find a seat, grab a program and a glass of water, and get your camera ready!</p>

		<p>If you're worried about finding parking near Redwood Bowl, we've got you covered too. You can park in the lots at the corner of Union and 14th streets (lots G14 and G15) or the lot opposite the Student Business Services building (lot FS9) and catch a shuttle to the ceremony instead. Shuttles will be running continuously from these lots.</p>

		<p><a style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.humboldt.edu/commencement/maps/commencementMap.pdf">Check out this campus map for more Commencement info [PDF] &raquo;</a></p>

		<p><strong>Make it Green</strong></p>

		<p>Last year, students, including the group HSU Takes Back the Tap, coordinated HSU's first ever bottle-free event of its kind. This year they'll continue to reduce the number of single-use bottles, while also working to minimize the number of disposable coffee cups.</p>

		<p>Look for water stations in Redwood Bowl to refill your reusable water bottles. If you don't already have a reusable container, you can purchase one from our students during the ceremony. They'll make sure to keep you happy and hydrated with free refills on water and coffee.</p>

		<p>Another "green" tradition that we're keeping up is our use of Greenweaver bachelor gowns. Each soft, breathable gown is made from approximately 23 recycled plastic bottles!</p>

		<p>In addition, the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology is helping to offset waste by encouraging students to recycle their caps and gowns after the ceremony. Mementos are important, but recycling caps and gowns lowers the cost for students who rent them the next year and reduces campus waste, so make sure to discuss this with your student ahead of time.</p>

		<p><strong>The HSU Bookstore: More Than Just Books</strong></p>

		<p>Still need graduation gear? Never fear! Even if your grad missed out on Grad Fair, they can still find their commencement ceremony needs at the <a style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.hsubookstore.com/home.aspx">HSU Bookstore</a>. They have caps, gowns, tassels, commencement invitations and even custom thank you cards.<p>

		<p>It's also a great place to snag yourself a memento from your student's alma mater! You can treat yourself to a Humboldt hoodie or coffee mug while you're in town for graduation.</p>

		<p>To see what we've got in stock for graduation <a style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.hsubookstore.com/home.aspx">checkout the Bookstore's website &raquo;</a></p> 

		<p><strong>Some Final Details</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Don't forget to confirm your travel plans and any reservations you've made.</li>
			<li>Be sure to have cash on hand if you think you might want to purchase souvenirs or Hawaiian leis (always a favorite) at the ceremony. </li>
			<li>And a big "Congratulations" to all Parents &amp; Families of graduating students!</li>
		</ul>

		<p>"What's been my best experience at HSU? All of it, but most of all working with campus clubs like Take Back the Tap, who helped me make lifelong friends. I have become so much more connected and confident on campus thanks to Take Back the Tap. The people I have worked with have also been truly inspirational in my life." <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/meet/ourstudents/bio/singh.php" title="Kylee Singh - Our Grads - Meet Humboldt" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">Read More &raquo;</a></p>

		<h3 style="font:18px helvetica, arial, san-serif;margin-top:32px;">Overheard this month on the family network</h3>																															<p>"To those parents concerned about connecting in SFO: don't be worried. Your kids will be just fine. United's flights are quite frequent into Arcata, so it's unlikely they'll have to overnight there. If by chance they do, they'll spend the night at a hotel near the airport and head back to try again the next morning. Tales to tell.</p>
		<p>The big disappointment to me is United's tickets are going to get that much more expensive. Off to Amtrak we go!"
