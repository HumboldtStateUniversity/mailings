											<h1 style="font:24px helvetica, arial, san-serif;margin:32px 0 0 0;">Moving Out &ndash; In an Eco-Friendly Way</h1>
											<p style="margin:0;">Desiree Perez</p>

	<p>The academic year is quickly coming to an end and students &ndash; from freshmen to graduates &ndash; are in a time of transition. In most cases, that means moving into a new place. Whether your student is moving off-campus or out of town, here are ways to reduce those piles of move-out waste.</p>

	<p><strong>Donation Dash </strong></p>

	<p>If your student is moving out of on-campus housing, Donation Dash is an easy way to donate reusable goods. Starting finals week, there will be special recycling bins in residence halls, as well as Donation Stations open Monday - Thursday from 8 a.m. - 8 p.m, and Friday from 8 a.m. to midnight, with special hours on Saturday, May 15.  </p>

	<p>Accepted goods range from clothing and alarm clocks to small furniture and non-perishable foods. Household items and clothing will go to local thrift stores and charities. Donated office supplies will go to HSU's Reusable Office Supply and Exchange. Kyle Stammerjohn of the Waste Reduction and Resource Awareness Program has these tips to help your student move out as efficiently and sustainably as possible:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>"The main thing is to think about what you have, what you're going to keep and what you don't want. Then start sorting it out." Know what's recyclable and reusable, and don't throw out anything that isn't actually garbage. </li>
	<li>To keep loads manageable, "start moving things out ahead of time. Think ahead and do it in stages. Plan on taking multiple trips. And don't leave it for the last day."</li>
	<li>And please, "no open toiletries or cosmetics should go into the bins. No dirty or wet clothes. And no undergarments."</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Summer LEAP</strong><br/>

	<p>HSU students Jessie Bakken and Megan Mansfield will pick up reusable goods as part of their volunteer work for Summer LEAP (Leadership Education Adventure Program.) They'll take anything that's in re-sellable condition. Donations will be sold at garage sales in May, and all proceeds will go toward the program.</p>  

	<p>Summer LEAP provides affordable single-day adventures for young people between seven - 18 years old. Activities include rock climbing, backpacking and rafting. According to Bakken and Mansfield:</p>
	<ul><li>"Pick up days are Friday and Sunday afternoons. Call ahead if you have bulky items to see if we can accommodate you."</li>
	<li>They're especially interested in reducing the number of abandoned bikes on campus. "If you have a bike you don't want, we'll take it!"</li></ul>

	<p><strong>Arcata Community Recycling Center</strong><br/>
	(707) 822-4542<br/>(707) 445-4321 ext. 203 for bulky items (ask for Ryan or John)<br/>
	<a href="http://www.arcatarecycling.org" title="Arcata and Eureka Community Recycling Centers" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">www.arcatarecycling.org</a></p>
	<p>Open seven days a week from 10 a.m. - 5 p.m., the Arcata Community Recycling Center accepts household goods, furniture, dishware, appliances and more (but no clothing).The center's Allison Poklemba says:</p>
	<ul><li>"We offer recycling opportunities good for when you're moving out, like computer monitors, printer cartridges, light bulbs, etc."</li>
	<li>Want to get rid of that old couch? The center will come pick it up&mdash;for a $15 fee.   </li>
	<li>The center accepts many items. See their website for a complete listing, but be aware that various fees may apply.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Angels of Hope Thrift Store</strong><br/>
	(707) 822-5019</p>

		<p>Angels of Hope is a community thrift store that offers great deals, free goods to the needy and assistance for at-risk youth. They take donations Monday through Saturday, from 10 a.m. - 4 p.m., women's clothing on Tuesdays and furniture whenever they're open. According to Eva Dickson and Shannon Hardin, who work for the store:</p>
	<ul><li>"We try to take everything possible if it's in sellable condition. Please do not bring in things that are broken, pet stained, damaged, missing pieces or moldy."</li>
	<li>Angels of Hope has a truck and can do pick-ups. Call ahead for large items.</li>
	<li>Never leave donations outside the store. "It just becomes trash." </li>
	</ul>
