												<p>Hello Humboldt families! We hope this newsletter helps keep you involved with your student's experience at Humboldt State.</p>

												<h1 style="font:24px helvetica, arial, san-serif;margin:32px 0 0 0;">A Student's View of Homecoming</h1>
												<p style="margin:0;">Desiree Perez</p>

		<p>Homecoming &amp; Family Weekend was an extravaganza this year &ndash; and because I was reporting on the events, I got to stay wrapped up in the festivities for a bit longer. As part of my job on campus, I went out with a video camera and captured images of people and happenings large and small. I just finished editing my footage last week. Check out my short <a style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.humboldt.edu/homecoming/index.php#pf-video">Homecoming video</a>.</p>

		<p>At the Arts Showcase, I hung out with the jugglers, watched the dancers and got to dig the jazz. I talked to a fraternity brother from Delta Sigma Phi who was back at Humboldt State for his 50th reunion. KHSU-FM had a music sale there, too. I volunteer at the radio station, so I greeted friends and bought an awesome new CD for $1 &ndash; student-friendly pricing for sure!</p>

		<p>Classes Without Quizzes gave parents a taste of students' academic experiences at HSU, but I get enough of the classroom experience Monday through Friday. Instead, I acted as a roving reporter amid the growing crowd. I also held a hermit crab while talking to marine biology students &ndash; they brought the crustaceans down from the HSU Marine Lab in Trinidad to give weekend visitors a feel for their field of study.</p>

		<p>While heading to the tailgate party and barbecue, I walked through the MultiCultural Center's sixth annual Native Alumni barbecue. It was the culminating celebration of Indigenous Peoples' Week. All were welcomed to enjoy the freshly grilled food, good conversations and questionable karaoke.</p>

		<p>I talked with Marylyn Paik-Nicely, Director of the center about the festivities and the importance of community, stayed for a slightly off-key rendition of Sublime's "What I Got," then continued on my way.</p>

		<p>At around 4 p.m., tailgaters were setting up tents, tossing footballs and catching up with old friends. Some were giving away food and goodies. Delicious beer-jalapeno-and-onion marinated bratwurst were on the menu. I'm trying to go vegetarian, but I couldn't resist a free bratwurst &ndash; it was my very last meat treat, and it was so worth it.</p>

		<p>When the Marching Lumberjacks arrived, the happy murmuring crowd started to get pumped up for the game. Soon, everyone was migrating to the football stadium. I saw body-painted people chanting "Let's Go Jacks!" I saw a sea of people waving yellow inflatable Lumberjack axes, courtesy of the Alumni office. I even saw one student with a vuvuzela, the plastic horn notorious for its droning noise during last year's World Cup festivities.</p>

		<p>The Jacks beat Dixie State 28 - 3. That major victory was a great way to end the night. And a relaxing breakfast buffet at the "J" on Sunday morning was the perfect wrap-up for Homecoming &amp; Family Weekend at Humboldt.</p>

				<p>"In Belize [with HSU's Sierra Institute], I remember jumping into a clear, fast stream and emerging downstream from a limestone cave where bioluminescent bacteria covered the ceiling above broken pieces of Mayan pottery. Flying through the river, I caught glimpses of spider monkeys curiously watching me from the canopy above."<br /><a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/meet/ourstudents/bio/jirinec.php" title="Vitek Jirinec - Our Students - Meet Humboldt" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">Read More &raquo;</a></p>

				<h3 style="font:18px helvetica, arial, san-serif;margin-top:32px;">Overheard this month on the family network</h3>																															<p>"We had such a wonderful time seeing our son and meeting his roommate's families. It was great spending time together on campus and going to the football game. I felt in the short time he's been at HSU he's already matured. I'm enjoying our new relationship without the daily hassles as well, although I still miss him dearly. Every time we go to Humboldt, we appreciate the school, campus, and natural beauty of the area more and more. I know in my heart this is the best possible place for our son!" <a href="http://www.hsufamilynetwork.org/" title="Sign In to HSU Family Network - HSU Family Network" style="color: #0082a1; text-decoration: none;">Read more &raquo;</a></p>
