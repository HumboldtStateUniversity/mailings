Encourage your student to contact their professors during office hours. Many students who had previously been nervous about visiting their professors have found it easier to meet with them virtually.

                                                    Face-to-face instruction ends Nov. 6, and Fall Break runs Nov. 23-27. Students living on campus who plan to return in January are not required to stay in housing after Nov. 6 and may leave their belongings until the start of the Spring Semester.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Students who elect to leave for the rest of the Fall semester and don't plan to return for Spring will be released from the remaining rent and board charges by following the Request to Vacate procedure that was emailed out recently to all Housing residents. Contact Housing with any questions about this process:
                                                    <a href="mailto:housing@humboldt.edu">housing@humboldt.edu</a> or <a href="tel:7078263451">707.826.3451.

                                                    In particular, recall that <strong>if students travel outside Humboldt County for any reason, they must quarantine for 14 days prior to returning to campus.</strong> That means not visiting campus services, and not returning to their in-person job. Traveling can have serious consequences for student employees--unless they work virtually, they'll miss at least 14 days of work. And keep in mind that HSU has limited quarantine spaces available for Housing residents.

                                                    The Campus Community—students, staff, and faculty—has collaborated closely and had a successful and safe semester so far. Through rigorous testing, adherence to safety protocols, and a full campus response to COVID-19, there are currently no active cases in the campus community.

                                                <p>
                                                    This year has proven to be the worst wildfire season in California's history. These fires have disrupted the lives of some HSU students during already challenging circumstances.
                                                </p>

                                                    Evacuation, loss of internet, poor air quality and for some, the loss of a home are devastating events but with your support, students can keep learning and progress to their degree.
