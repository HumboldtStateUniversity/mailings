					   <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Staff and Faculty,</p>
					   
					   <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Humboldt State University has always been a leader in the field of Sustainability. Our University Vision embodies the major principles of Sustainability and there are many examples of projects, curricular programs, and campus activities that demonstrate this commitment. In the last few years, the campus has formalized this commitment by hiring a Sustainability Coordinator and creating the Office of Sustainability (OS) to manage and support related campus activities.</p>
					   
					   <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Statewide and nationally, Sustainability in Higher Education is emerging as a focal point in creating trans-disciplinary curricular programs, enhancing the efficiency of campus physical operations, and promoting responsible purchasing and investment of campus resources. To provide a way for benchmarking progress and demonstrate it to others, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE), in collaboration with representatives from a consortium of higher education institutions, constructed the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS) after an intensive two year process. Since the initial release in 2008, STARS has been refined via an ongoing evaluation process and input from the 324 institutions registered to participate in the system. The key elements to STARS are that it is a transparent, self-reporting framework for a participating institution to use in measuring their overall sustainability performance and progress over time. Detailed <a href="https://stars.aashe.org/" style="color: #476a31;">information about STARS</a> can be found on the AASHE website.</p>
					   
					   <p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">As part of our commitment to Sustainability, the campus will implement STARS at HSU beginning in the 2012 Fall Semester in order to measure progress and compare ourselves with other institutions. The Office of Sustainability (OS) will be responsible for conducting the assessment, but will require active participation from virtually all offices and departments of the University in reporting data for their respective operations/responsibilities. During the summer and early Fall Semester, the OS will be contacting many of you to provide more information about the specific information your office/ department may need to provide. The OS will also help offices and departments evaluate and resolve obstacles or difficulties anticipated in producing the necessary data. The formal collection of data is expected to begin in September and conclude at the end of the Fall Semester, with a validated rating anticipated by the end of the 2012-13 academic year.</p>
