									The formal self-study includes a detailed analysis of campus operations and activities associated with becoming a comprehensive polytechnic, which will be outlined in a final report to be submitted in September to the Chancellor’s Office for further consideration.

									As part of the ongoing commitment to consultation, HSU is holding an open general session led by Provost Jenn Capps, in addition to a session led by two working groups: the Academic Programs and the Cross-Disciplinary Integration and the Role of the Liberal Arts. </p>
								<p
									style="color: #585858; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 0 18px 0; padding: 0; line-height: 20px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial, san-serif;">
									The working groups will present a brief update on their work to date, which includes a description of existing strengths at HSU. There will also be an opportunity to participate in the process for our next steps—proposing new programs that will build on our strengths as we reimagine the polytechnic for the 21st century.</p>

									The safety of our Lumberjack community and their families is a priority. All plans depend on approval by state and county public health officials and are subject to change based on the status of the pandemic.</p>

									The Academic Programs working group will report on existing programming in science, applied science, engineering, and technology at HSU and recommend a phased plan to have at least three degree programs in each of the four areas by the polytechnic designation (2023). They will also propose potential new programs to round out HSU’s broad academic offerings. <a href="https://www.humboldt.edu/polytechnic/working-groups" style="color: #25551b;">Learn more about the charge for the Academic Programs working group</a>.

									The Cross-Disciplinary Integration and Role of the Liberal Arts working group is tasked with documenting HSU’s existing strengths and new opportunities, and creating a model vision for the role of HSU’s liberal arts disciplines, the infusion of the liberal arts in multidisciplinary teams, and other cross-disciplinary integration. <a href="https://www.humboldt.edu/polytechnic/working-groups" style="color: #25551b;">Learn more about the charge for the Cross-Disciplinary working group</a>.

									HSU announced in November that the California State University asked the University to undertake a self-study toward becoming designated a polytechnic. The request offers the momentous possibility of HSU becoming one of just three polytechnic universities in the state, and the only one in Northern California. It would better position HSU to meet specific workforce needs on the North Coast and statewide, and it would significantly raise HSU’s profile among prospective students and grant-funding organizations.
