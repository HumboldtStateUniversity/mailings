          Hopefully this newsletter sees all of the Lumberjack Nation doing well! I am excited to bring this first quarterly newsletter to your inbox. Even though we are in a pandemic, our student-athletes, coaches, staff and alumni are still doing a lot of amazing things, as you can tell by the articles below.

          Our student-athletes had one of their best semesters to date in the Fall, with three of our teams, women’s basketball, softball and rowing, achieving their best term GPA in ten years. As a department, we captured the Award in Excellence, thanks to our women’s basketball team’s Race for Change and women’s soccer team’s Bracelet for Change.

          As we work through the challenges of Spring 2021 semester, campus leadership is working hard to provide opportunities for participation with guidance from public health, the NCAA and our fellow system and non system schools. There are a lot of examples of institutions participating successfully and we look at their achievements as guideposts. Knowing that not all things are equal but we can try to make this semester, the best student experience we can under the circumstances.

          There is no easy way to build a plane while flying it but we are trying. We have implemented, with consultation from Humboldt County Public Health officials, frequent testing and participation protocols of all student-athletes and staff. We will continue to test every week and will test while away from home too. We practice in small groups, making it tough for teams to be together as a unit. We maintain our commitment to social responsibility; We mask up while on campus and will mask up while we participate away from home. If and when we leave the county, we will quarantine upon our return. We know that the virus our nation has been battling over the past year has shown its transmission is indiscriminate and risk cannot be completely eliminated. I cannot express how the opportunity to return to a sense of “normalcy” for students and staff has had an exponential positive mental health effect to return to the ‘physical lab’ of the field or court. Your continued support of LumberJack Athletics, our student-athletes, HSU and the amazing Humboldt County community is greatly appreciated. We are in this together and #WeRUnitedJacks.
