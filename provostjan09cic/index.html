					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">It is my privilege to share with you the individuals who have been chosen to serve on the new Committee for Institutional Change.  They are:</p>
					
					<blockquote><p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Randi Darnall Burke<br>Dan Davis<br>Mary Glenn<br>Matt Johnson<br>David Kornreich<br>John Meyer<br>Justus Ortega<br>Adrienne Colegrove Raymond<br>Phil Rouse<br>Steve Smith<br>John Woolley<br>Beth Weissbart</p></blockquote>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The Cabinet for Institutional Change will begin work immediately.  Its charge is to</p>
					
						<ul>
							<li>design a process for the identifying and prioritizing critical areas in which institutional planning and action are needed.</li>
							<li>establish a process for successful planning and action for each of these critical areas using a framework that identifies
								<ul><li>the individual(s) and group(s) responsible for planning, approval and implementation.</li>
									<li>clear goals and objectives.</li>
									<li>an implementation plan for achieving goals and objectives.</li>
									<li>a timeline for all phases, from planning to implementation to evaluation.</li>
									<li>the informational resources necessary for successful planning and action.</li>
									<li>Cost estimates associated with implementation.</li></ul>
								</li>
							
							<li>develop a plan to involve campus constituencies in the process of institutional  change that emphasizes building community, ownership and accountability.</li>
							<li>develop a communication plan that allows the Cabinet to monitor and report all institutional change activities to the campus.</li>
						</ul>

					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Both the WASC Visiting Team Preparatory Review and the Keeling and Associates' report identify a consistent pattern of decentralized and fragmented decision-making processes and structures that make it difficult if not impossible for Humboldt to establish and achieve university -wide objectives.  Here are some of the WASC Visiting Team comments:</p>
					
						<ul>
							<li>"The oversight and approval of curriculum, including general education, appears to be decentralized to the point of being less than cohesive."</li>		
							<li>"A major concern is that the approaches that have been taken to the allocation of resources so far have tended to favor the status quo, making it difficult to formulate decisions around strategic priorities."</li>
							<li>". . . HSU does not have an adequate institution wide analysis and research capability."</li>
							<li>". . . governance and decision-making processes at the University are complicated, cumbersome, and difficult to understand."</li>
							<li>"This decentralized budget management within HSU has contributed to a silo attitude toward problem solving and organization change.</li>
							<li>"The general culture resists the notion that resources can be reallocated . . . and seems to not conceive of an opportunity for restructuring existing functions and personnel to achieve [a strategic] objective."</li>
							<li>"A critical ingredient to this future [in which Humboldt is able to build on its strengths] will be the degree to which HSU can come together, unite around its emerging vision, and sustain a process for making good use of data and for making optimal decisions about its future."</li>				
						</ul>
						
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The Keeling report emphasized the need to build a university community in which all constituencies take ownership and accountability for developing institutional processes and structures for effective decision-making.  We need processes that engage all campus constituencies in making strategic choices.  Disagreements are inevitable, so building our capacity to work together in resolving disagreements successfully will be an important component in this process.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Institutional change at Humboldt must incorporate both elements.  We need to develop processes and structures that allow effective institutional planning and we need to develop community, ownership and accountability among all constituencies.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">This is a daunting task, but one I believe the campus is ready to face.  Together we can make these changes.  Working as a community we can make Humboldt a model of how to prepare an increasingly diverse student body for the challenges they face locally, nationally and globally.</p>
