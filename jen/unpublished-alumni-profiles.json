You will meet so many outstanding educators and students like yourself from all over the country.

It was like and intensive personal vision quest and I built a lot of cool functional and non-functional things and learned a ton in a very short period of time.\r\rI chose the multiple subjects credential program because I wanted to help people rather than continue to feed the capitalism machine.

I floated around with a full-time load for 10 years, changing my major regularly. (My Humboldt transcript was 10 pages long.) My first Bachelor's was in Theater Arts.

The town I grew up in California was very small and my high school graduating class only had 20 students so when I found out how small Humboldt was and how small/local Arcata was I felt very comfortable knowing that it would have the same small town feeling. 2. The location and weather. Living all my life in Winterhaven, CA/ Yuma AZ where summers are well over 100 degrees I was looking for a big change and to get out of the desert. When I saw the catalog for HSU I thought it was another state or planet! I wasn't prepared for as much rain and cloudy days as there was, but I welcomed them and often miss those days now. 3. The ability to be start with no skills/ beginner and still be able to make my dream come true. I am so thankful and lucky that the music department and Humboldt allowed me to become a music major with no true background in music though I had a big passion! I am in awe of all of the classes and professors that took the time to show me everything beautiful thing about music so I can now share it with my students!",
            "field_alumni_program_prepare": "Again, I am go grateful and lucky to have been able to attend HSU. I feel that it was such a great place for me. Since I had very little background in music. I had played trumpet in band from 7th-10th grade, but unfortunately my music program was cut so that is all the knowledge I had. Thankfully HSU and the music department allowed me to major in music eventually music education and fully prepared my to become a K-12 music teacher. I started with basic knowledge in music and progressed every semester/year to become proficient in all aspects of music education. It was not an easy task for me but I made it! I am thankful to all of my professors, mentors, peers, and everyone who helped in my journey to help and pushed me to achieve my dream!",
            "field_alumni_program_enjoy": "What I enjoyed the most about the program was the feeling of being welcome even though I did not have much background only passion and also the connections made with other people, now friends from all over. I always felt welcome in my classes and ensembles which was so nice being a very shy person. Also, connecting and playing/performing with new people in classes and ensembles was always challenging but definitely fun for me. ",
            "field_alumni_program_recommend": "I would let prospective students know that this program is definitely for you if you prefer small city/classes and the music department will definitely prepare you to become a successful music educator! Of course as anything in life, it will be a challenge and you'll have to put 100% effort but it will be worth it! Also, extra bonus if you love the ocean, beautiful trees, cloudy weather, majestic sunny days, and friendly and interesting people!",
