					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Dear Campus Community,</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">I strongly urge <strong>all current HSU students, staff, and faculty aged 24 and younger</strong> to participate in one of the following H1N1 (swine) flu NO-COST vaccination events offered at the following campus venues: </p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Friday, Nov 13 Jolly Giant Commons 2nd Floor 10:00 AM-4:00 PM</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Tuesday, Nov 17 University Center South Lounge 9:00 AM-6:00 PM</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Wednesday, Nov 18 Jolly Giant Commons 2nd Floor 10:00 AM-7:00 PM</strong></li>
					</ul>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">These vaccination clinics are the outcome of collaboration among federal, state, county, and HSU authorities. Strict guidelines are in place regarding who is eligible (and who is not) for this series of HSU community vaccinations.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Eligible Group: The ONLY persons who will be vaccinated at these venues must meet ALL of the following criteria:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Current HSU student, staff, or faculty  (bring current HSU ID card)</li>
						<li>Age 24 or younger on the day of the vaccination (bring government-issued photo ID or driver's license with date of birth; students aged 17 or younger must also present a consent form signed by a parent or guardian, available at <a href="http://studentaffairs.humboldt.edu/_download/registration_consent.pdf" style="color: #546a38;">http://studentaffairs.humboldt.edu/_download/registration_consent.pdf</a>.) </li>
						<li>Must bring both ID's to get vaccinated</li>
					</ul>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Persons NOT eligible for H1N1 vaccination:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Spouses, significant others, children, friends,  and colleagues who are not current HSU students, staff, or faculty aged 24 or younger</li>
						<li>Alumni, retired, and emeritus HSU employees</li>
						<li>People who have a severe allergy to chicken eggs</li>
						<li>People who have had a severe reaction to an influenza vaccination</li>
						<li>People who developed Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of getting an influenza vaccine previously</li>
						
					</ul>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Those who do not meet the eligibility criteria above should contact their own health care practitioner about H1N1 vaccination. The Centers for Disease Control anticipates that eventually there will be enough vaccine distributed for everyone who wishes to be vaccinated, but not everyone will be able to receive it on campus. As supplies become available, vaccine will be distributed through private practitioners in the coming months.</p>
                            
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">If you have recently had the flu, you are still eligible to get vaccinated unless you had a definitive lab test confirming that you had H1N1 flu.</p>
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The upcoming HSU vaccinations will be dependent on the supply and demand. Over 2,000 doses of vaccine have been secured for the upcoming campus vaccinations. Only one dose of H1N1 vaccine per person should be needed to adequately protect the targeted group being vaccinated on campus. The vaccinations at these HSU venues will be administered by a nurse.</p>
				   	<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The H1N1 vaccine has been evaluated by many agencies and experts, and has been deemed extremely safe. More information about safety of flu vaccine, links to important websites, and answers to frequently asked questions about H1N1 vaccination may be found at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/flu" title="H1N1 (Swine) Flu Information &bull; Humboldt State University" style="color: #546a38;">www.humboldt.edu/flu</a>.</p>
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">About ten days after vaccination, the body begins to produce antibodies providing protection from the H1N1 virus. So, the sooner the better to start getting vaccine to our HSU community members.  If you are eligible for vaccination, please take advantage of one of the upcoming free vaccination events.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Rebecca Stauffer MD<br/>
					Director, Student Health and Counseling </p>
