					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Campus Community,</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">As discussed in a previous all campus memo, the H1N1 (swine) flu is now occurring in the campus community as well as the surrounding community. The several known student cases have been similar in severity to seasonal flu. Because H1N1 is the dominant circulating influenza strain, we are no longer testing to determine the type of flu individuals have contracted.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The numbers of people sick with the flu will likely rise, but the best way to reduce the overall impact of the flu is to slow or interrupt its spread. I want to remind you to <strong>practice good hand hygiene, cover your coughs, and stay home when ill until fever is gone for at least 24 hours and you are feeling well.</strong></p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The campus recommendation, based on the best advice of organizations like the Centers for Disease Control, is for students who are ill to stay away from classes as well for staff and faculty who are ill to stay away from work. People with serious illness or underlying conditions such as pregnancy, asthma, diabetes, heart, lung, neuromuscular, or kidney disease, or immunosuppression should seek medical care if they become ill.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">It will take the entire campus community to limit the spread of the H1N1 flu and lessen the impact of what is expected to be an especially severe flu season. Please be as flexible as possible with students, employees and community members, and please pay close attention to your personal health.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">You can keep informed about the flu and the campus situation by checking <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/flu/" style="color: #546a38;">http://www.humboldt.edu/flu</a>. The website contains updates as well as plenty of guidance on immunizations, prevention, what to do if you are ill, and recommendations for faculty, staff and students.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Thank you.</p>
