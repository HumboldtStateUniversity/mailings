					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">As we start the Fall semester, we expect to see cases of Novel H1N1 (swine) flu. This flu has been widespread in California all summer and you may have had it yourself. If not, you may be exposed over the coming weeks and months as it is in the local community.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">HSU has an updated Pandemic Response Plan and a dedicated website at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/flu/" style="color: #546a38">www.humboldt.edu/flu</a> with current information regarding H1N1 as it affects the campus, as well as links to key public health information sites.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The H1N1 flu symptoms consist of fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Many people also have reported diarrhea and vomiting. Severe illnesses and death have occurred as a result of illness associated with this virus.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 8px 0px 0px 0px;"><strong>Prevention</strong></p>
					
					<p style="padding: 0px 0px 4px 0px;">Our best bet for minimizing the impact of this virus on campus is to embrace the following well established public health recommendations:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li style="padding: 4px 0px;">Wash your hands frequently or use alcohol-based hand cleaner</li>
						<li style="padding: 4px 0px;">Cough in your sleeve or cover your cough with a tissue (discard tissue and wash hands)</li>
						<li style="padding: 4px 0px;">Avoid contact with ill persons and practice good hygiene if someone in your home is ill</li>
						<li style="padding: 4px 0px;">Do not share food, drink, or utensils</li>
						<li style="padding: 4px 0px;">Stay home if you are ill</li>
						<li style="padding: 4px 0px;">Protect yourself with flu vaccine:
						<ul>
							<li style="padding: 4px 0px;">Seasonal Flu Vaccine:  Is recommended for everyone and is available at cost for students at the Student Health Center. Staff and faculty are encouraged to get vaccinated through their medical provider or public health ($7 donation).</li>
							<li style="padding: 4px 0px;">Novel H1N1 Vaccine:  Vaccine is currently in clinical trial and due to be released in October. Priority groups will receive initial vaccine and may include students up to 24 years old and those with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, heart and lung diseases, or a weakened immune system. Watch the <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/flu/" style="color: #546a38">www.humboldt.edu/flu</a> website for current information on availability.</li>
						</ul></li>
					</ul>
					
					<p style="padding: 8px 0px 0px 0px;"><strong>Treatment and Response</strong></p>

					<p style="padding: 0px 0px 4px 0px;">The majority of individuals who contract this virus will not need to seek a doctor's treatment.  Faculty, staff, and students who are ill with flu should remain at home (or in their room) until 24 hours after they are fever-free (without medication that would lower temperature) and well. Obviously ill individuals should be asked to go home until they are well. Encourage ill students to phone the Student Health Center (3146) for screening and appointments.  A mild, lingering cough may persist and without any other flu symptoms, notably fever, should not prevent students from returning to class.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">If you have been in contact with someone who has the flu, onset of illness can take from 1 - 7 days.  If you experience flu symptoms within this time period, please stay home to limit the spread of the virus.  If you are pregnant, or if you have a chronic medical condition such as diabetes, cancer, asthma, heart or lung problems, or a weakened immune system, you should consult your physician.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We will attempt to keep the campus informed concerning changing pandemic conditions and we encourage everyone to take personal responsibility and follow the prevention measures outlined above.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,<br>Rebecca Stauffer<br>Student Health Center Director</p>
