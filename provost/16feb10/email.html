					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Dear Faculty and Staff:</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">As the Director of the HSU Student Disability Resource Center and on behalf of the CSU, we invite your participation in the Faculty and Staff Evaluation of the services provided to students with disabilities at the California State Universities. This is a great opportunity to let us know how we are doing as an office and a campus in serving students with disabilities. Please take 10 minutes to provide us with this very important feedback. Your answers will remain confidential and the results of the survey will be available within a few months.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The CSU Policy for the Provision of Accommodations and Support Services for Students with Disabilities outlines that feedback on services to students with disabilities be sought from students, faculty and staff every five years.   The survey is fully accessible and can be found at <a href="http://california-state-university.dss-faculty-staff-survey.sgizmo.com">http://california-state-university.dss-faculty-staff-survey.sgizmo.com</a>. The survey is open through February 19, 2010, so please be sure to complete the survey before the deadline.  The survey is also available in alternate format. To make a request, please contact me at <a href="mailto:Kevin.OBrien@humboldt.edu">Kevin.OBrien@humboldt.edu</a> or stop by the Learning Commons (lower level of the library).</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Thank you for your assistance!</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Kevin O'Brien, Director<br>
					Student Disability Resource Center and Testing Services</p>
