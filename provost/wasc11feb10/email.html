					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">To the University Community:</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Last week's visit by a WASC team represents a major milestone in HSU's ongoing accreditation review cycle.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">At the team's wrap-up meeting marking on Friday, as at many of the meetings earlier in the week, team members had very positive things to say. They emphasized how impressed they were by the progress that the campus has made since their last visit two years ago. They also emphasized how important it is for the campus to keep the momentum of change and improvement going.</li>

					 <p style="padding: 4px 0px;">For example, the team cited progress in assessing student learning, and members urged the campus to continue and broaden those efforts. They also cited progress in addressing issues related to the success of underrepresented students, while noting that there is much room for improvement as we continue this important work.</li>

					 <p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The team commended the report recently issued by the Cabinet for Institutional Change, noting it as evidence that HSU is prepared to continue making progress in improving educational effectiveness. They strongly endorsed the Cabinet's recommendations, especially those aimed at reorganizing campus governance and developing a more collegial campus culture. </p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The ongoing process of accreditation review comprises three phases. The first phase, during which we prepared an Institutional Proposal to serve as a framework for the review process, began in early 2005. The second phase was the Capacity and Preparatory Review, which culminated in the Spring of 2007 with the WASC team's first visit, its subsequent report, and the official recommendations of the WASC Accrediting Commission. We are currently in the third phase, which focuses on evaluating HSU's educational effectiveness.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The WASC team's visit, which began last Wednesday, was an important part of that third phase. The five team members, four of whom had also been on the previous visiting team, met with many members of the campus community. Meetings were organized around specific topics related to the ways in which we achieve and improve educational effectiveness at HSU. </p> 
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The Steering Committee thanks those who met with the visiting team to provide a range of perspectives on the issues, as well as those who did all the work to prepare for and support the team's visit.</p>
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The campus will receive the team's final report in April, and an official action letter will be issued by the Commission in July.</p>
