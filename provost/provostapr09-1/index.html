					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Campus Community,</p> 

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We have recently completed a number of important steps in the Academic Program Prioritization process, and I wanted to inform you about the progress.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Late last month, following more than a year of focused effort, the Program Prioritization Task Force submitted its final report. Shortly after, each of the College deans provided their recommendations related to that report. I have reviewed this material and developed a set of recommendations for moving forward.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">All of these documents, along with other material related to the prioritization process, are available online at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~aavp/Prioritization.html" style="color: #687819;">www.humboldt.edu/~aavp/Prioritization.html</a>.</p> 

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">My recommendation includes steps to be taken for programs that the Task Force recommended for augmentation, as well as those that were recommended for restructuring or elimination. These recommendations will be considered by an ad hoc committee of the Academic Senate, and I will then work with the deans, department chairs and others to implement them. In many cases, I have asked for detailed plans to move forward by the end of this semester.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">In addition, the deans will be planning within their Colleges for programs that the Task Force recommended should be supported at or near their current resource allocation, as well as for programs that the Task Force recommended be closely examined for possible reorganization or resource reduction. The deans will also be working with programs that the Task Force recommended be reexamined after three years.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">This prioritization process has admittedly been difficult and time-consuming. However, I believe it will position Humboldt State to be much more successful in the years to come. Prioritizing our academic programs allows us to compare programs using common criteria that are linked to the University's mission, vision and values. It provides us with the information we need to link resource allocation to strategic planning.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The process has shown, as I believe we all knew, that as a campus we are trying to do too much. We have more programs than we can adequately support, given our size, and we need to focus on doing fewer things and doing them well.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">I want to thank the Program Prioritization Task Force and the campus community for their work on this process. Many individuals have given a great deal of time and energy to this effort, and we should all be grateful for their service.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Bob Snyder<br />
					Interim Provost</p>
