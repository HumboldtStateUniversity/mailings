					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Dear Campus Community,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Over the last year, the Cabinet for Institutional Change has been developing ways to make Humboldt State University a more effective and responsive institution. We were brought together after numerous difficult challenges were identified by outside experts, including those evaluating us for reaccreditation.  Our report is now completed.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">A copy of the report, as well as background material about the Cabinet, is available at <a href="http://change.humboldt.edu" style="color: #546a38">http://change.humboldt.edu</a>.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Now, the more difficult work begins.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">At the heart of our report is a call for campus-wide change and renewal. This must occur in all the interrelated areas on which we focused: ensuring student success, university vision, governance, collegial community and evidence-based decision-making. With governance, in particular, we offer a detailed plan for reinventing what currently exists. We also identify a series of meaningful short-term steps to invigorate our university vision, while recommending refining this vision statement in the longer-term.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">With these recommendations, we believe we have met the expectations of the campus community. In the coming months, we expect to play a continuing role in the campus discussions about our recommendations. In essence, we now see ourselves as continuing advocates for campus change and renewal. We care about HSU, and we think we have identified important changes that, if carried out, will serve the campus and our students for years to come.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Our efforts over the last year were possible because the campus community proved willing to give time and energy to the process. Hundreds of you joined us for forums, town halls discussion and focused group work. You provided feedback through our website, and your units and divisions answered our many specific questions. You also contacted us and met with us individually to discuss the challenges. We are grateful for your participation.</p>


					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;"><em>Adrienne Colegrove-Raymond, Randi Darnall Burke, Dan Davis, Mary Glenn, Matt Johnson, David Kornreich, John Meyer, Justus Ortega, Phillip Rouse, Steven Smith, Robert Snyder, Beth Weissbart, John Woolley</em></p>
