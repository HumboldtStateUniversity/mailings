					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Campus Community,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Over the past eight months, we, the members of the Cabinet for Institutional Change have been developing ways to make Humboldt State University a more effective and responsive institution. We write to update you on the progress and our plans for the coming months. We hope to complete our remaining tasks by next March.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Many of you will recall that the Cabinet was convened after numerous difficult challenges were identified by campus members as well as outside consultants.  University governance groups and the administration charged the Cabinet with initiating comprehensive reforms at Humboldt State University, with the goal of making the institution more effective and responsive.  As we see it, our responsibility is to assist the campus to develop the capacity to tackle these challenges in a collaborative and effective manner.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">To date, actions and recommendations developed by the cabinet include the following:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Suspend committees and clarify the charge for the ones that remain in order to lessen workloads and to focus efforts on key priorities.</li>
						
						<li>Bring representatives from other campuses to discuss and review alternate models for campus governance to be considered for adoption at HSU.</li>
						<li>Convene an Enrollment Management Task Force, with faculty, staff, adminstrator, and student representation, intended to develop strategies for ensuring achievement of student learning outcomes and inclusive academic excellence.</li>
						<li>Establish an Office of Institutional Research to strengthen our ability to make crucial decisions based upon clear evidence and to evaluate the success of such decisions.</li>
						<li>Review, prioritize and implement recommendations for fostering collegiality across the campus.</li>
					</ul>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Our efforts have been possible because the campus community was so willing to give time and energy to the process. Hundreds of you joined us for forums, town hall discussions and focused group work. You provided feedback through our website, and your units and divisions answered our many specific questions. You also contacted us and met with us individually to discuss the challenges. We set out to host a campus discussion, and you made the decision to give it a chance by participating. For that, we are extremely grateful.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">A summary and timeline of activities and work in progress in each of our five focus areas is available on our website at: <a href="http://change.humboldt.edu" style="color: #546a38;">http://change.humboldt.edu</a>.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Members of the Cabinet for Institutional Change</p>
