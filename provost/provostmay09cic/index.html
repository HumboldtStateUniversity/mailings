					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Dear Colleagues,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">As you know, the Cabinet for Institutional Change was formed in the spring semester to coordinate change efforts on campus.  We began by developing a set of guiding principles, indentifying five focus areas and developing a website to facilitate communication. Now we want to let you know what progress we have made this semester and our plans for the future.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">After we agreed on focus areas, the first step was to assign Cabinet members to each area to develop action plans.  We needed to determine what efforts were already in progress for each of the focus areas and what we found was that a surprising amount of work is already underway (e.g. in the WASC areas of student learning outcomes and inclusive academic excellence).  The Cabinet will catalog and help coordinate these efforts so that we do not duplicate efforts or work at cross-purposes.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The next step was to talk to different groups and individuals about how to move forward with the institutional change effort.  This involved a combination of talking to formal groups such as the Academic Senate and Staff Council, informal groups such as data experts and community-building experts and holding well-attended open meetings in such areas as "collegiality" and "vision."  This part of the process has been and continues to be time-consuming but we believe it is crucial to the success of the project.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We are now in a position to begin developing recommendations in each of the areas.  In some areas that process has already started.  In others it will start in the fall semester. We expect that by the end of the fall semester, and no later than early in the spring semester, we will have recommendations approved for each of the areas.  These recommendations will have clear objectives, measurable benchmarks and detailed implementation plans.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">University-wide engagement and support are critical for the success of this institutional change effort and we thank everyone who has participated.  So far, our conversations with the University community have been encouraging.   However, it's clear that much remains to be done, particularly in the areas of governance and collegiality.  The recent no-confidence vote highlights dissatisfaction and problems with campus decision-making, but we have concluded that the only way we can constructively address these problems is to continue our work.  Clearly the University community recognizes the need for change and we believe is ready to move forward.  As we develop recommendations, we will continue to consult widely and to update our progress on the Cabinet's website.  Working together, with clear objectives, we can make the changes necessary for Humboldt to not only weather this economic downturn but also develop the capacity, as a campus community, to act creatively and effectively to ensure our students' success and our ability to achieve our distinctive vision.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">For more detailed progress reports in each of the focus areas please visit our website at <a href="http://change.humboldt.edu/" style="color: #546a38;">http://change.humboldt.edu/</a>.  Please let us know what you think.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Thank you for your attention and support.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,<br><br>
					The Cabinet for Institutional Change</p>
