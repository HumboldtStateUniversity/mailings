					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Campus Community,</p> 

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">I would like to formally introduce to the campus an Office that has recently come under the purview of Academic Affairs &ndash; the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. Formerly reporting to the President's Office, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion was relocated this semester to Academic Affairs, in recognition of the centrality of diversity to every part of the educational process. </p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">For those of you who have not yet come in contact with their work, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is charged with developing policies for our campus that seek to institutionalize diversity as a core part of HSU's mission, and to overcome the historical and social inequities that continue to challenge students, faculty and staff from underrepresented groups. </p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">In addition to its new name and new reporting structure, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion has also come under new leadership this past year. As of last semester, this office is now directed by Professor Patty Yancey, of our School of Education, and Radha Webley, who joins us from Columbia University, where she is working on a PhD in Political Science. </p> 

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Since coming aboard with Academic Affairs, Patty and Radha have been working closely with us to integrate our campus' efforts to track, monitor and report on diversity-related data. They have also been working with Academic Personnel Services to develop a plan to diversify our faculty. They continue to work with the Diversity Plan Action Council, the MultiCultural Center, Student Affairs, and other campus entities to support cultural programs, educational experiences and professional development opportunities for students, staff and faculty that work to deepen understanding across various groups, to advocate for social justice, and to improve the climate in classrooms and other institutional spaces.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">This office was formerly directed by Professor Llyn Smith (Anthropology) and Jyoti Rawal (Student Affairs). Llyn is now leading the efforts of the WASC II Action Team (Making Excellence Inclusive), another key effort in achieving HSU's commitment to student success. Jyoti, now Associate Dean of Students, also continues to co-chair the Diversity Plan Action Council (DPAC), a group appointed by President Richmond in Fall 2005 to oversee progress toward successful fulfillment of HSU's Diversity Action Plan. The Office of Diversity and Inclusion works closely with both the DPAC and the Making Excellence Inclusive teams.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The Office of Diversity and Inclusion is on the web at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~diversity/" title="Office of Diversity and Inclusion: Welcome">http://www.humboldt.edu/~diversity/</a>. Their website is currently in the process of being revamped to include a library of resources for students, faculty, staff and administrators on diversity-related issues. An announcement will be sent out as soon as that update is online.</p>

					

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Bob Snyder<br />
					Interim Provost</p>
