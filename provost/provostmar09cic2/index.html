					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Campus Community,</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The Cabinet for Institutional Change is very interested in your ideas to help address important areas of change on campus. We know HSU has many talented and creative individuals, and we're working hard to capture our community's best thinking.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">There are many ways you can communicate with us, share your thoughts and participate. They include:</p>
						
					<ul>
						<li>Visit our website to learn about the Cabinet - <a href="http://change.humboldt.edu" style="color: #687819;">http://change.humboldt.edu</a></li>
						<li>Read and comment on the Cabinet's blog, which is on our website.</li>
						<li>Offer suggestions and vote on ideas by clicking "share your ideas" on our website.</li>
						<li>Attend a Cabinet forum or other public event.</li>
						<li>Attend a meeting with a campus group that is addressing one of the Cabinet's areas of focus.</li>
						<li>Contact a Cabinet member (e-mails and phone numbers are on our website).</li>
					</ul>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The Cabinet is charged with initiating comprehensive reforms at Humboldt State. We were formed in response to issues raised during the current WASC reaccreditation process and at the recommendation of Keeling &amp; Associates. Our focus is on five areas: realizing our University vision; improving campus governance; achieving student success; creating a culture of evidence; and cultivating a collegial, respectful and responsive community.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We thank everyone who attended our kick-off campus forum on March 9. About 200 people were on hand, and there were many helpful comments and questions.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Since that forum, there have been some questions about how to use the "share your ideas" section of our website. This uses a relatively new third-party service called Uservoice, but please don't let the technology deter you. It's easy once you get started.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">To use it, click the "share your ideas" link at <a href="http://change.humboldt.edu" style="color: #687819;">http://change.humboldt.edu</a> and follow the signup link near the top right of the page. After registering, you can vote or comment on suggestions. You can also submit suggestions by following the link to one of the forums and entering a header for your idea under "My suggestion is ..." The system will search for similar ideas, and give you the choice either to vote for one of them or "create new idea." If you choose to create a new idea, you'll have a chance to enter a longer description of it under your header.</p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Sincerely,<br />
					HSU's Cabinet for Institutional Change</p>

					Randi Darnall Burke<br />
					Dan Davis<br />
