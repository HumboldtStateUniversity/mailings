					<tr>               
						<td class="mainbar" align="center" valign="top" style="padding: 22px 0 0 14px; text-align: left;">
							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">Dear Campus Community:</p> 
							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">We have recently begun campus discussions about a new student fee to support hands-on learning at Humboldt State. It is designed to ensure we can continue funding the special facilities and extra classroom experiences that have become a hallmark of an HSU education.</p>

							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">The proposed Materials, Services and Facilities Fee would be $144 per semester for full-time students, a cost that would be considered in determining financial aid. It would generate almost $2 million, to be allocated to HSU's three Colleges, starting in Fall 2010. The fee would eliminate most existing fees, including lab course fees and shop card fees.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">The decision to propose this fee was not taken lightly. I know that it would be a financial burden on our students, who also face the possibility of another CSU fee increase this year.</p>

														<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">However, after years of severe state budget cuts, there are no good choices left. HSU has already increased class sizes, reduced class offerings, implemented employee furloughs, and reduced the number of working months for many staff and faculty. We are making painful decisions about eliminating some of our academic departments, and we are leaving many open positions unfilled. But it will not be enough to balance our budget going forward.</p> 
						        
							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">This proposed fee would support HSU learning opportunities that are often unavailable to undergraduate students at other institutions. These include such things as the Research Vessel Coral Sea, the wildlife game pen, the on-campus fish hatchery, the extensive greenhouse, on-campus art galleries, the human performance kinesiology labs, scuba-diving equipment, a broad range of art facilities including a foundry and ceramics studio, and the child development lab. There are many others.</p>

							<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">These facilities make possible the type of educational experiences that HSU students have come to expect. Without the proposed new fee, we may not be able to fund them. Many, if not all, of the services and facilities that the fee is designed to support could be lost.</p> 

							<p  style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">We are seeking input on this proposed fee from across campus. The deans and I will meet with Associated Students and with the Academic Senate, and we will ask that department chairs set up meetings with their students to discuss the fee. In addition, a comment form is available on the Academic Affairs website. A decision will be made by the end of the Spring semester.</p>

														<p  style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">To submit a comment about the fee proposal, and for more information and updates, visit the Academic Affairs website at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~aavp" title="Academic Affairs">www.humboldt.edu/~aavp</a>.</p>
