					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Dear Colleagues:</p> 

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Working drafts of the four main sections of our Educational Effectiveness Review (EER) Report have now been posted on the new website for our WASC reaffirmation of accreditation efforts. This report describes the progress we have made since the Capacity and Preparatory Review (CPR) stage nearly two years ago.  Preparing these drafts has been a collaborative effort by the EER Steering Committee members, with the assistance of numerous other members of the campus community. </p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We invite you to <a href="http://humboldt.edu/~wasc" title="College of Natural Resources and Sciences &bull;" style="color:#546a38">review the drafts</a> and send us your feedback by October 16, using the "Contact Us" link provided on the site; each section has been posted separately to facilitate your review. The four sections parallel the four chapters of our CPR Report.  That report, along with the report of the CPR Visiting Team, is also available on our WASC website. </p>

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The final version of the EER report will be sent to the EER Visiting Team next month. All of the team members who visited us in 2007 will be returning for the EER visit February 3-5, 2010.   </p> 

					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">We look forward to hearing from you. In the meantime, the EER Steering Committee continues its work on the report, with the introduction, conclusion, and data exhibits in development.</p>
