to update you on the CalPERS Dependent Eligibility Verification
Project (DEV) that begins on July 1, 2013.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow, serif">In a
previous email we discussed the scope of the project--CalPERS will be
conducting an audit of all current health plan participants to ensure
that only eligible dependents are receiving health plan benefits.  We
also mentioned that there is currently an amnesty period occurring
through June 30, 2013, during which time employees may remove
ineligible dependents prior to the end of the amnesty period with no
financial consequences.</FONT></P>
