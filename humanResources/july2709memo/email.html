					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">A meeting is planned for Tuesday, July 28, 2009 at 2:00 p.m. in Van Duzer Theater to discuss Humboldt State's furlough plan for employees who fall in the indicated groups above. In addition to CSUEU and Human Resources representatives, the Vice Presidents will be present to answer your questions regarding furlough. Humboldt State's furlough plan has been published and can be viewed at: <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~humboldt/furlough/campusPlan.pdf" style="color: #546a38;">http://www.humboldt.edu/~humboldt/furlough/campusPlan.pdf</a>.  A similar meeting is planned for 10/12 and 11/12 employees on August 17, 2009, tentatively scheduled for 2 p.m. in Science B 135.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Human Resources is also launching a new web site tomorrow with support services available to employees as furloughs get underway.   In addition, Paula Nedelcoff of the Employee Assistance Program will make two presentations titled "Concrete Skills for Copying with Change" on Wednesday, July 29, 2009 from 10 a.m. - noon in Goodwin Forum and on Tuesday, August 4, 2009, from noon -2:00 p.m. in Goodwin Forum.  Her presentations will cover tips and practices for dealing with emotional tensions relating to change and added financial pressures.  To register for these workshops go to <a href="http://training.humboldt.edu/" style="color: #546a38;">http://training.humboldt.edu/</a> or call Jim Stemach at Ext. 5177 for registration assistance.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Furloughs is a new concept for all of us at Humboldt State University and The California State University (CSU).  It may be necessary as more information unfolds about furloughs in the CSU that modifications to our current understanding of furloughs will need to be made.  Please be sure to bring forward your questions and concerns regarding furlough to your supervisor, your union representatives   and/or Human Resources.  For our campus to succeed, we will all need to work together.</p>
