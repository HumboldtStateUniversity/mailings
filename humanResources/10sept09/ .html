					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;"><strong>Furlough Date Change</strong></p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">The campus has found it necessary to make a change to the Staff and Management Furlough Calendar.  The change is necessary because of Humboldt Preview, which is typically offered when high school students have their Easter/Spring break.  This year the logical date for Humboldt Preview is April 9, 2009, which had been identified as a staff and management furlough day.  After consultation, the furlough date has been changed to Friday, April 16, 2010.  We realize this change may have an impact on staff/managers and their families.  We are asking that administrators be flexible in the rescheduling of this furlough day and work with employees to mitigate any impact.  The on-line Staff and Management Furlough Calendar and furlough plan information have been updated to reflect this change.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;"><strong>Health Fair Reminder</strong></p>
