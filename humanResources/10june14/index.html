It is your responsibility, as a government employee, to report any type of fraud, waste, or abuse, which ultimately protects scarce state resources, and to be free from retaliation for doing so.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 0; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">In 2013 alone, we received 3,103 allegations of wrongdoing from state employees and members of the public, most of which concerned misuse of state property, improper travel expenditures, and time and attendance abuse. Whistleblower complaints have triggered investigations revealing millions of dollars in wasteful spending in recent years, such as:</p>

<li>Two state departments wasted state resources worth nearly $170,000 by improperly accounting for time off taken by their employees during a 12-month period.</li>
<li>An administrator of a veterans’ home squandered more than $652,000 by executing two wasteful contracts that did not comply with state contracting requirements. One contract was for the construction of an adventure park on the grounds of the home. The other contract was for the operation of a café and tavern at the home that could have been operated at no cost to the home.</li>
<li>A state department missed an opportunity to collect an estimated $516 million in benefit overpayments owed to the State by failing for more than three years to participate in a program to intercept the federal tax refunds and other federal payments of those who were overpaid.</li></ul>

	<ul style="color: #333333; font-family: helvetica, arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0 0 10px 30px; padding: 4px 0px; text-align: left;">
<li>Prepare Before Filing. Before we can investigate your complaint, we must understand what you are alleging. We have found that complainants are more effective in communicating with us if they gather their thoughts before filing a complaint and prepare themselves to answer the following questions: What is the improper activity? Who acted improperly? Where does that person work? How can we prove your allegation is true? Why do you think the activity is improper?
	</li>
<li>Support What You Allege. To open an investigation regarding your complaint, we need to know that evidence exists to support what you are alleging. So when you file a complaint, it is very important that you describe the evidence that proves what you are saying and that you give us the names and telephone numbers of knowledgeable witnesses. It also is very helpful for you to provide us with copies of any documents you have in your possession that will support what you are saying. Please do not submit original documents, as they cannot be returned.
	</li>
<li>Consider Providing Contact Information. You have a right to file a complaint without providing your name or any other information about who you are and how we may contact you. However, we may not be able to investigate your complaint if we cannot talk to you to confirm the information you are providing or obtain additional information. Please remember that if you identify yourself to us we will not reveal your identity to anyone else without your permission, except to appropriate law enforcement personnel who are conducting a criminal investigation.
	</li>
<li>Keep Your Complaint Confidential. We investigate complaints as confidentially as possible to protect both your identity as a whistleblower and our ability to gather information without interference. To protect the confidentiality of your complaint, we encourage you not to tell anyone that you filed a complaint with us.
	</li>
</ul>

We investigate complaints and report substantiated allegations to the head of the employing agency, the Legislature, and the Governor. In addition, some of the substantiated allegations will be reported to the general public, keeping confidential the identities of the state employees involved.
