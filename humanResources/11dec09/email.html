					<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">In celebration of the 2009 holiday season, the Governor has authorized informal time off for the day before the Christmas holiday or the day before the New Year's Day holiday. Campus Presidents have been authorized to provide informal time off subject to the following:</p>

										<p style="padding: 4px 0px;"><strong>Monthly Rate Employees:</strong><br/>Full time exempt and non-exempt employees may be allowed a half day informal time off with pay on the last campus working day before the Christmas holiday or the last campus working day before the New Year's holiday, if the employee is scheduled to work. (Please note this informal time off can not be used on a day the campus is closed.)  Less than full-time employees should be provided informal time off on a pro-rata basis.  </p>

										<p style="padding: 4px 0px;"><strong>This year due to the campus furlough plan, the last campus work day before the holidays is an instructional day (last day of finals).  It is important that the campus services remain available until the close of business on December 18, 2009.  Please work with your supervisor regarding the use of this informal time off.</strong></p>

										<p style="padding: 4px 0px;">Employees required to work these days, or who would be scheduled to work but are on vacation, sick leave, or CTO may be granted the equivalent informal time off prior to June 30, 2010. This time shall not be considered CTO and is not compensable in cash.</p>

										<p style="padding: 4px 0px;"><strong>Hourly Employees:</strong><br/>Hourly employees other than Student Assistants and Work Study students, should be permitted informal time off based on the following table provided that the employee is scheduled to work on the campus' last work day prior to the holiday closure and is still on the active payroll on that date (has not or will not be separated with a prior effective date):</p>
